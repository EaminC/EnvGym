current progress

- The Docker image builds and runs successfully on x86_64/amd64 with OpenJDK 17 (slim), Maven 3.9.6, and Git installed.
- All essentials for Java/Maven-based development are present.
- No GPU/CUDA/NVIDIA tools or ARM/ARM64 binaries are included, as required.
- GraalVM Native Image and Kotlin installation sections are present but commented out (not installed by default).
- The Dockerfile adheres to the plan’s hardware and OS requirements.
- Project workspace is set, but the fastjson2 repo is not cloned by default (instructions are commented).
- The image is general-purpose for development, but does not yet include code or automated build/test steps.

next step

- Uncomment and enable the GraalVM Native Image installation section if native image support is required for your use case.
- Uncomment and enable the Kotlin compiler installation if any Kotlin modules are needed.
- Uncomment the `git clone` line to automatically clone the fastjson2 repository during build, or ensure project files are mounted/copied as appropriate for CI/CD.
- Optionally add a `RUN mvn -T 1C clean install` step if you want to pre-build the project within the image.
- Review if any additional dependencies for Solon, Spring, or other frameworks are needed and add installation steps as necessary.
- Update/verify the Dockerfile’s labels and documentation fields if more details or accuracy are needed.
- Add or update documentation to highlight that this setup is strictly for Linux x86_64/amd64 (per plan item 16).
- If Android SDK or IDE support is required, handle their installation outside of this image as noted in the plan.
