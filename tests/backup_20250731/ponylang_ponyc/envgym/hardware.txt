- Working Directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ponylang_ponyc; project likely related to Pony language, located within a nested data directory.
- Architecture: x86_64; recommended --platform=linux/amd64
- Base Image: Use amd64-compatible images (e.g., ubuntu:22.04, debian:bullseye, alpine:latest); avoid ARM images.
- GPU: No NVIDIA GPU available; do not use CUDA or nvidia/cuda base images.
- Instruction Notes: No GPU-specific instructions (e.g., no --gpus, no NVIDIA libraries); multi-core builds possible (use parallel build tools if desired); ample RAM and storageâ€”no resource-based limitations.
- Docker Version: 28.3.2; supports BuildKit and modern Dockerfile features; no GPU build support required.
