current progress
- Base environment (Ubuntu 22.04, user cc, working directory) is set up.
- All key dependencies (OpenJDK 8, Ant, CMake, GCC, Git, Python3, etc.) are installed.
- MiniSat is cloned and built successfully.
- Project files are copied into /home/cc/EnvGym/data/SymMC.
- Directory checks and diagnostics for Enhanced_Kodkod are present in the Dockerfile.
- Docker build fails because required files/directories in Enhanced_Kodkod are missing: build.sh, build.xml, src/, lib/, util/.

next step
- Ensure the source tree you COPY into the Docker build context contains Enhanced_Kodkod/build.sh, Enhanced_Kodkod/build.xml, Enhanced_Kodkod/src/, Enhanced_Kodkod/lib/, and Enhanced_Kodkod/util/ (with actual content, not empty or missing).
- Verify these files and directories exist in your local context before building the Docker image.
- If using .dockerignore, ensure it does NOT exclude Enhanced_Kodkod or its contents.
- After correcting the context, rebuild the Docker image to proceed past the Enhanced_Kodkod build checks.
