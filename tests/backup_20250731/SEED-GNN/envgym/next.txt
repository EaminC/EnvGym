current progress
- The Docker image builds and runs successfully.
- Python 3.9 and pip are installed and up to date.
- System dependencies (git, wget, bash, build-essential, ca-certificates) are installed.
- Working directory is correctly set to /home/cc/EnvGym/data/SEED-GNN.
- requirements.txt is copied and used to install project dependencies.
- PyTorch 2.0.0 (CPU-only) is installed from the official CPU wheel index.
- PyG CPU-only extensions (torch-scatter, torch-cluster, torch-spline-conv, torch-sparse) are installed from the correct CPU wheel index.
- All additional Python dependencies from requirements.txt are installed.
- Source code and scripts are copied into the image.
- All .sh scripts in scripts/ are made executable.
- The container runs a command to verify Python, PyTorch version, and that CUDA is not available (CPU-only).
- No GPU/CUDA components are present in the image.
- The base image is x86_64 compatible (python:3.9-slim-bullseye).
- No CUDA Toolkit or +cu* wheels are used.
- The build and runtime logs confirm correct versions and CPU-only operation.

next step
- Verify that torch-geometric==2.3.1, torchvision==0.15.1, torchaudio==2.0.1, numpy==1.24.4, pandas==2.0.3, and ogb==1.3.6 are present in requirements.txt (and not torch, torch-scatter, torch-cluster, torch-sparse).
- Ensure torch-spline-conv is not installed redundantly (remove from requirements.txt if present, since it is installed explicitly).
- Add validation/test steps to the Dockerfile or as part of CI to:
  - Import all major packages (torch, torch_geometric, torchvision, torchaudio, ogb, etc.) and check for import errors.
  - Run a minimal script to ensure torch.cuda.is_available() returns False.
  - Optionally, run a minimal pretraining or editing script to confirm end-to-end functionality.
- Ensure that config files and shell scripts referenced in the plan exist in the correct locations and are valid (e.g., JSON validity).
- Update README.md in the repo to highlight CPU-only setup, correct PyG install instructions, and explicitly state no CUDA/GPU is required.
- Optionally, add tests for version mismatches, duplicate installations, and error handling as described in the plan.
- (If not already done) Document the full environment setup for reproducibility as per the plan.
