current progress  
The Dockerfile is correctly set up with a multi-stage build using the amd64 Debian 12-slim base image. It installs all necessary build dependencies, clones the jq repository, runs autoreconf, configures with appropriate flags including static build and oniguruma builtin, compiles using all CPU cores, runs verbose tests, installs the stripped binary and metadata files, and produces a minimal final scratch image with the jq binary and metadata. The previous Docker build and runtime logs show successful build and jq version output, confirming correctness on the amd64 platform without GPU dependencies.

next step  
Add comments and labels to the Dockerfile for clarity and maintainability. Verify volume mounts and working directory settings in example Docker run commands are consistent with the Dockerfile context. Optionally, implement a Makefile or build script wrapper to automate the Docker build and test process. Document the Dockerfile usage and testing procedures in the project README. Finally, schedule periodic rebuilds and updates to ensure jq and dependencies remain current.
