current progress
- Dockerfile uses ubuntu:22.04 base image aligned with x86_64 architecture.
- Environment setup installs essential packages and Python3 with venv.
- Working directory is correctly set to /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/collected_stats.
- Source code copied into the working directory.
- Python virtual environment created at /home/cc/EnvGym/venv and activated via PATH.
- Build and runtime logs indicate successful Docker build and execution.
- No GPU-specific tools or configurations included.

next step
- Explicitly specify platform as linux/amd64 in the Dockerfile (e.g., add `FROM --platform=linux/amd64 ubuntu:22.04`).
- Ensure Docker Compose files (if any) also specify the platform.
- Include installation of any additional required dependencies or tools compatible with amd64.
- Add BuildKit-specific instructions or optimization if applicable.
- Verify volume mounts and ensure they map correctly to the working directory in runtime.
- Consider adding health checks or entrypoint scripts for better container lifecycle management.
