=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

(Note: Adjustments are made to ensure full compatibility and optimal setup on x86_64 Linux (Ubuntu 22.04) environment without GPU, targeting amd64 architecture, and considering Docker usage and local development needs.)

---

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:

- Node.js (version 16.x or later strongly recommended for full ES6+ support, native AbortController, and compatibility with latest tooling; ensure downloading amd64 Linux binaries or using NodeSource PPA on Ubuntu 22.04 amd64)
- npm (comes bundled with Node.js 16+)
- Optional alternative package managers: yarn, pnpm, bun - ensure linux/amd64 compatible versions installed
- Git (Ubuntu 22.04 package or latest stable version for cloning/version control)
- Code editor (e.g., VSCode for Linux x64)
- Browsers for testing: latest Chrome, Firefox, Edge (via Ubuntu packages or official Linux x64 releases), Safari not available natively on Linux (use Sauce Labs or remote testing)
- Form handling libraries and polyfills:
  - 'form-data' (runtime)
  - 'formdata-node' (dev)
  - 'formdata-polyfill'
- Query string serialization:
  - 'qs'
- Polyfills and helpers:
  - 'abortcontroller-polyfill' (only for Node.js <16; optional here since Node 16+ recommended)
  - 'node-domexception'
  - 'web-streams-polyfill'
- Dev dependencies: Babel, Rollup with plugins, Webpack and CLI, ESLint and plugins, Husky v8.x, Commitlint packages, Mocha, Karma and Karma plugins, Jasmine, Sinon, dtslint, dts-critic, tslint, cross-env, gulp v4+, gulp-cli, minimist, auto-changelog, release-it, chalk, pretty-bytes, proxy-related libraries, axios (runtime and gulpfile usage)
- Version compatibility notes:
  - Node.js: use version 16+ for full compatibility (Ubuntu 22.04 amd64 easily supports Node 16+)
  - npm: version 6+ (comes with Node 16+)
  - Browsers: Since Safari is unavailable natively on Linux, rely on Sauce Labs for Safari tests
  - TypeScript: ^4.9.5 or later, compatible with `"module": "node16"`
  - Ensure all binaries and tools are linux/amd64 compatible

Additional Notes:

- Since the hardware environment is Linux x86_64 without GPU, no CUDA or GPU-specific tools are needed or included.
- Node.js 16+ is well-supported on Ubuntu 22.04 amd64; no ARM or other architecture adjustments required.
- Paths and working directory `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/axios_axios` are used consistently for all file references and scripts.
- Docker usage (if any) should specify `--platform=linux/amd64` to match hardware architecture.
- Browsers for Karma testing will exclude Safari locally; use Sauce Labs for cross-browser coverage including Safari.
- No Windows or macOS specific path or tooling adjustments needed.
- All build tools, linters, and test runners are compatible with Linux amd64 and Node.js 16+.

This adjusted plan ensures seamless development, build, test, and release workflows on the specified hardware and OS environment with consistent tooling and configuration.
