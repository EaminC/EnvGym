=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:  
   - Rust toolchain (Rust 1.74.0 or higher) for building from source and using cargo  
     * https://rustup.rs/  
     * Minimum Rust version explicitly specified as 1.74 in Cargo.toml; ensure toolchain matches or exceeds this version  
     * Use x86_64 Linux binaries/installers compatible with amd64 architecture  
   - `bat` prebuilt binaries or packages depending on OS:  
     * Linux (Ubuntu/Debian): `bat` or `batcat` via apt or latest `.deb` (e.g., `bat_0.25.0_amd64.deb`)  
       - Ensure installation targets amd64 architecture (matches x86_64 hardware)  
     * Alpine Linux: `apk add bat` (amd64 packages available)  
     * Arch Linux: `pacman -S bat` (amd64 packages)  
     * Fedora: `dnf install bat`  
     * Gentoo: `emerge sys-apps/bat`  
     * FreeBSD: `pkg install bat` or ports tree  
     * OpenBSD: `pkg_add bat`  
     * openSUSE: `zypper install bat`  
     * macOS: Homebrew `brew install bat` or MacPorts `port install bat` (if applicable; note hardware is Linux, macOS only for cross-platform docs)  
     * Windows: one of WinGet, Chocolatey, Scoop, or prebuilt binaries (not applicable for current Linux hardware setup)  
   - Git (for Git integration features, cloning repositories, and local configuration)  
     * Use standard x86_64 Linux Git packages  
   - Optional tools for enhanced integration and usage:  
     * fzf (for preview integration)  
     * ripgrep (for batgrep)  
     * fd (for find-like functionality used in integration)  
     * less pager (especially on Windows, but also recommended on Linux)  
     * xclip (for clipboard integration on Linux)  
     * Visual C++ Redistributable for Windows (not required on Linux x86_64)  
   - Additional Rust dependencies implied by Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock (for building from source):  
     * Build dependencies and features as specified in the updated `tests/syntax-tests/source/TOML/Cargo.toml` file:  
       - Features and dependencies as described, compatible with Rust 1.74.0 and x86_64 Linux  
     * Rust edition 2018 specified in Cargo.toml; compatible with Rust 1.74.0+  
     * Build script `build.rs` present as required  
   - Version compatibility requirements:  
     * Rust toolchain ≥ 1.74.0 (consistent with Cargo.toml MSRV)  
     * `bat` version 0.25.0 or higher for binaries; source build version 0.15.4 also supported/tested  
     * Cargo.lock dependencies versions locked and consistent with Cargo.toml versions for reproducible builds  
   - Formatting tool:  
     * Rustfmt included with Rust toolchain; install via `rustup component add rustfmt` if missing  
     * `rustfmt.toml` with default settings present  
   - Syntax highlighting and language support:  
     * `syntect` v4.2.0 used with features enabled as specified  
     * Support for Dockerfile, Python requirements.txt, DotENV, Java Server Page (JSP) syntax highlighting fully compatible with Linux x86_64 environment  
     * Licensing compliance for JSP files ensured  
   - Licensing and compliance:  
     * Verify compliance with included licenses for JSP files and third-party components as per plan  
   - No conflicts with existing configuration or version requirements introduced by hardware environment (Linux x86_64)  

2. FILES TO CREATE:  
   - All configuration files, source files, test files, and license/notice files as specified, paths and formats compatible with Linux x86_64 environment  
   - User configuration file path for `bat` as per Linux conventions (e.g., `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bat/config` or `$HOME/.config/bat/config`)

Verification Methods (Linux x86_64 specific):  
- Verify `bat --version` outputs expected version (≥ 0.25.0) on Linux amd64  
- Confirm syntax highlighting visually for Dockerfile, Python requirements.txt, DotENV, JSP files on Linux terminal with syntect v4.2.0  
- Use `bat --list-themes` and `bat --list-languages` on Linux to verify availability of new languages and themes  
- Confirm integration commands execute without error on Linux shell  
- Monitor logs and error messages on Linux environment  
- Validate all config files load and apply correctly on Linux paths  
- Confirm system-wide config `/etc/bat/config` is loaded and effective on Linux  
- Confirm no Windows-specific config files interfere on Linux (ignored or skipped)  
- Confirm Cargo builds succeed on Linux amd64 with locked dependency versions  
- Confirm build scripts and asset generation succeed on Linux  
- Run dev-dependency tests on Linux  
- Confirm no conflicts from multiple dependency versions on Linux  
- Verify error handling with unsupported encodings and terminal capabilities on Linux  
- Confirm code formatting compliance via `cargo fmt -- --check` on Linux  
- Confirm Git integration tests run using Linux paths for config files  
- Confirm configuration precedence order enforced on Linux environment  
- Confirm licensing and notice compliance for JSP files on Linux filesystem  
- Confirm Dockerfile, Python `requirements.txt`, DotENV `.env`, JSP `.jsp` syntax highlighting produce correct colored output and lexer/parser behavior on Linux terminals  

Notes on adjustments:  
- No ARM or other architecture support required or included; strictly x86_64 amd64 Linux environment targeted  
- No GPU or CUDA dependencies included or required  
- Windows-specific installation steps and config files exist in plan for cross-platform completeness, but for this environment, only Linux-specific steps are mandatory; Windows-specific config files will be present for completeness but are ignored in Linux environment  
- Paths and environment variables adjusted for Linux conventions (e.g., `/etc/bat/config`, `$HOME/.config/bat/config`)  
- All tooling and dependencies installed and tested for Linux amd64 compatibility  
- Build and test commands run in Linux shell environment; no Windows PowerShell or CMD specifics needed  
- Memory and CPU resources assumed sufficient for parallel builds and multi-stage builds without special adjustments  

This adjusted plan ensures full compatibility and optimal operation on the provided hardware environment: x86_64 Linux amd64 architecture, without GPU or Windows dependencies, using standard Linux tools and paths.
