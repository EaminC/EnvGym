current progress  
- Base image set to Ubuntu 22.04 with essential build tools and dependencies installed.  
- Rust 1.70 installed as default toolchain via rustup, plus nightly-2025-01-25 with minimal profile.  
- FreeBSD cross-compilation targets (i686 and x86_64) added.  
- Cargo upgraded with rustup component add cargo (though cargo is installed by default).  
- cargo-deny installed with retry logic and verbosity enabled.  
- spellcheck tool installed with cargo.  
- RUSTFLAGS temporarily disabled during installs, then set to "-D warnings".  
- RUSTDOCFLAGS set to "-D warnings".  
- Workspace set to /workspace with source copied in.  
- Cargo config created to enforce rustflags during builds.  
- Environment variable CROSS_BUILD_ENV_PASS set for passthrough variables.  
- Default command set to bash shell.  

next step  
- Add installation of Git explicitly if needed by some build steps or CI. (Git is installed currently, so verify if version meets needs.)  
- Ensure presence of spellcheck.dic file in /workspace root or copy it explicitly in Dockerfile.  
- Add configuration or script steps to run cargo-deny check and spellcheck during image build or CI runs for validation.  
- Integrate Cross.toml environment passthrough by copying Cross.toml into /workspace and linking or configuring cross build tools if used.  
- Add copying and setup of other config files (deny.toml, netlify.toml, spellcheck.toml, .cirrus.yml, .github directory) as required for full environment.  
- Consider adding rust-toolchain.toml to pin Rust version explicitly in workspace.  
- Verify environment variables RUSTFLAGS, RUST_BACKTRACE, and RUSTDOCFLAGS propagate correctly in all build and run steps.  
- Optionally add USER and permissions adjustments for non-root builds if security is a concern.  
- Add build steps to compile the tokio echo server example and run tests as part of container build or CI pipeline.  
- Document or script the usage of this Docker image to run the Tokio development and test environment.
