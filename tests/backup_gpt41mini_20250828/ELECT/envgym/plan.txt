=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN BASED ON HARDWARE INFORMATION ===

**Context:**  
- Host architecture: x86_64 (AMD64)  
- Working directory: `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/ELECT` (project inside user home directory)  
- No NVIDIA GPU present → no CUDA or GPU-specific dependencies  
- Docker version 28.3.2 available (supports BuildKit), but plan assumes native Linux environment setup  
- Standard Linux filesystem, typical Ubuntu/Debian-compatible environment assumed  

---

### 1. DOWNLOADS AND PACKAGE INSTALLATION ADJUSTMENTS

- **Architecture Compatibility:**  
  All packages and binaries targeted for x86_64 (AMD64), matching host architecture. Use standard Ubuntu/Debian packages (`apt-get install`) for amd64 architecture. No cross-architecture adjustments needed.

- **Java:**  
  OpenJDK 11 packages (`openjdk-11-jdk`, `openjdk-11-jre`) are fully compatible with x86_64. Confirm installation from native apt repositories.

- **Intel ISA-L Libraries and Dependencies:**  
  Packages `clang`, `llvm`, `libisal-dev` are available for amd64; no changes needed.

- **Python 3 and Tools:**  
  Use Python 3 and pip3 as usual; ensure pip corresponds to Python 3 environment. Confirm `python3` and `pip3` commands exist and are consistent.

- **Utilities and Network Tools:**  
  All utilities (`bc`, `iproute2`, `rsync`, `curl`, `jq`, `ssh`, `ssh-keygen`, `ssh-copy-id`, `ssh-keyscan`, `scp`, `sshpass`) are standard and available for amd64 Linux distros.

- **Systemd Utilities:**  
  `systemctl` is assumed available on all nodes (typical for Ubuntu/Debian amd64 systems).

- **No GPU-specific tools or libraries needed:**  
  No CUDA or GPU drivers are installed or required.

- **Maven Proxy Settings:**  
  Proxy settings remain optional and unchanged, ensure `.m2/settings.xml` is properly configured if behind a proxy.

### 2. FILE PATH AND DIRECTORY NOTES

- The project path is inside user home directory `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/ELECT`.  
  - All relative and absolute paths in `scripts/settings.sh` and other scripts must reflect this base path.  
  - Review and adjust all path variables in `scripts/settings.sh` accordingly:  
    - `PathToSSHPrivateKeyFile` → e.g., `/home/cc/.ssh/id_rsa` or specified private key path  
    - `PathToArtifact` → `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/ELECT/artifacts` or as appropriate  
    - `PathToScripts` → `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/ELECT/scripts`  
    - `PathToELECTPrototype`, `PathToColdTier`, `PathToYCSB`, etc., must be absolute or relative to working directory and consistent across all nodes.

- Ensure directory permissions and ownership allow `cc` user to read/write.

- The `src/coldTier/data/` directory on the cold tier node must exist before running `OSSServer`.

- Experiment backup/log/result directories on control node (`PathToELECTExpDBBackup`, `PathToELECTLog`, `PathToELECTResultSummary`) must be created and cleaned as per plan.

---

### 3. ENVIRONMENT AND TOOLCHAIN ADJUSTMENTS

- **Java Home:**  
  Confirm Java 11 installation path on amd64 system, likely `/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.11.0-openjdk-amd64`.  
  Export `JAVA_HOME` accordingly before builds.

- **Python Environment:**  
  Use `python3` and `pip3` explicitly if `pip` does not point to Python 3 environment. Adjust `scripts/setup.sh` to call `pip3 install` if needed.

- **SSH Key Handling:**  
  No architecture-specific changes needed, but ensure SSH key files have correct permissions (`chmod 600`) and ownership for user `cc`.

- **Rsync and SSH Parallelization:**  
  With potentially high CPU core count on x86_64, parallel rsync and ssh commands can leverage concurrency effectively.

- **No GPU-dependent build steps:**  
  Remove any conditional GPU-specific build or runtime instructions if present.

---

### 4. BUILD AND RUN PROCEDURES

- **Erasure Coding Library Build:**  
  The Intel ISA-L JNI library build steps remain the same; compatible with amd64.

- **ELECT Prototype Build:**  
  Apache Ant and Maven builds proceed normally on amd64; confirm JDK11 is used.

- **OSSServer Build and Run:**  
  Build and run on cold tier node as planned; no architecture-specific changes.

- **YCSB Benchmark Build and Run:**  
  Build with Maven on client node (amd64) remains unchanged.

- **Java and native library compatibility:**  
  Ensure native libraries (`libec.so`) are built for amd64 and linked correctly.

---

### 5. SCRIPT AND AUTOMATION NOTES

- **`scripts/setup.sh`**:  
  - Explicitly source `/etc/profile` to ensure environment variables load correctly on amd64 systems.  
  - Implement recommended optimization: copy SSH private key for user `cc` once **outside** the per-node loop to avoid redundant copies and permission issues.  
  - Use `pip3` explicitly if `pip` is ambiguous on amd64 nodes.  
  - Validate sudo password handling remains secure and functional on typical amd64 Ubuntu/Debian environments.  
  - Ensure `jq` and `curl` are installed on all nodes for time synchronization and JSON parsing.  
  - Confirm `rsync` version supports `--progress` on amd64; standard Ubuntu/Debian versions do.

- **`scripts/settings.sh`**:  
  - Verify all IP addresses and node lists are correct and sorted ascending.  
  - Confirm network interface detection script correctly detects interfaces on amd64 Linux nodes.

- **`setupOnEachNode.sh`**:  
  - Confirm executable permissions and compatibility with bash on amd64 Linux.  
  - Validate package installation commands (apt-get) work without issues on amd64.

---

### 6. TEST CASES AND VALIDATION

- All listed test cases remain valid and applicable to amd64 hardware; no changes needed.

- Additional recommendation:  
  - Validate that all native binaries and libraries are built for amd64 by running:  
    ```shell
    file path/to/binary_or_library
    ```  
    Expected output should mention "x86-64" architecture.  

- Verify environment variables and paths resolve correctly on amd64 nodes.

---

### 7. STORAGE AND RESOURCE CONSIDERATIONS

- No special storage constraints noted; verify sufficient disk space on all nodes to hold artifacts, build outputs, data directories.

- No memory or CPU limits specified; leverage available CPU cores on amd64 hosts for parallel builds and synchronization.

### 9. FINAL REMARKS

- The existing environment setup plan is well-aligned with the hardware environment (x86_64 Linux).  
- The main actionable adjustment is to verify and correct paths to absolute paths under `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/ELECT` to avoid relative path issues.  
- Implement the SSH private key copy optimization in `scripts/setup.sh` for user `cc` to improve efficiency and avoid permission problems.  
- Confirm Python `pip` commands correspond to Python 3; modify scripts to use `pip3` explicitly if needed.  
- No GPU or CUDA changes required.  
- Test all build and deployment steps in the amd64 environment to confirm compatibility before production use.
