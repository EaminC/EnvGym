current progress  
- Dockerfile uses official node:22-bullseye amd64 base image as planned  
- Working directory set correctly to Linux POSIX path `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/vuejs_core`  
- Git, curl, and necessary utilities installed via apt without recommended extras  
- pnpm 10.15.0 installed globally using npm  
- Node, pnpm, and git versions verified via RUN commands  
- Git user configured with placeholder values  
- Project files copied into container context  
- Dependencies installed using `pnpm install`  
- Relevant ports exposed for dev servers (3000, 5173)  
- Default CMD set to open bash shell at project root  
- Previous Docker build and runtime logs indicate successful build and execution  

next step  
- Remove or conditionally handle Git clone step as project files are copied directly, avoiding redundant cloning  
- Consider adding healthcheck or entrypoint script to automate starting dev server or build tasks if needed  
- Optionally configure Git user dynamically via build args or environment variables instead of hardcoded placeholders  
- Add cleanup steps or caching optimizations to reduce image size and build time if appropriate  
- Verify that pnpm install completes without architecture or platform errors in the container environment  
- Document usage instructions for running container with volume mounts to sync source code if development mode is intended  
- Confirm environment variables and Linux shell compatibility for all scripts inside the container  
- Optionally add multi-core build flags or parallelism tuning for pnpm or test tools if performance improvements are desired
