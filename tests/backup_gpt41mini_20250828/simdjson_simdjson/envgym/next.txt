current progress  
- Base image set to ubuntu:22.04 with linux/amd64 platform.  
- User and group created matching host user.  
- Universe and multiverse repositories added.  
- Installed build-essential, cmake, ninja-build, git, python3, wget, curl, sudo successfully.  
- Attempted to install libcurl4-openssl-dev, linux-perf, binutils, clang, clang++, lld, llvm but failed with exit code 100 during apt-get install.  
- Configured clang as default compiler alternatives.  
- Installed Node.js 16.x and npm, cleaned npm cache.  
- Configured passwordless sudo for user.  
- Created dependency cache directory and set working directory.  
- Installed Rustup and Rust stable toolchain as user.  

next step  
- Investigate and fix apt-get install failure for libcurl4-openssl-dev, linux-perf, binutils, clang, clang++, lld, llvm.  
- Possible actions:  
  * Add `apt-get update` immediately preceding the failing install command to ensure fresh package lists.  
  * Check for missing or incorrect repository sources or keys for required packages.  
  * Consider splitting the failing install command into smaller parts to isolate the problematic package.  
  * Add debugging commands (e.g., `apt-cache policy <package>`) in Dockerfile to verify package availability.  
- Once fixed, rebuild Docker image to validate successful installation of all required packages.
