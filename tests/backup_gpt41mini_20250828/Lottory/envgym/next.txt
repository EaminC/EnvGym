current progress  
- Dockerfile based on python:3.7-slim successfully installs system dependencies and Python packages from requirements.txt with pinned versions.  
- Virtual environment created and activated in /app/venv.  
- pip upgraded and dependencies installed without cache.  
- Verified python and pip versions.  
- Confirmed torch.cuda.is_available() returns False in build stage ensuring CPU-only PyTorch.  
- .gitignore and requirements.txt copied into container.  
- Build and runtime logs show successful build and execution of container.  

next step  
- Add copying of project source code files into /app directory after installing dependencies to enable running code inside container.  
- Add entrypoint or CMD to run baseline test command (e.g., `python3 main.py --prune_type=lt ...`) to verify runtime functionality.  
- Ensure runtime directories (/data, /dumps, /plots, /runs, /saves) are created or mounted as volumes if needed.  
- Optionally add scripts or commands to run test cases validating dataset loading, model instantiation, pruning, plotting, and CPU-only operation.  
- Document usage instructions and automate environment setup and tests within container.
