     - (Optional) virtual environment configuration files:  
       - `venv/` directory or conda environment yaml file for reproducible environments  
     - Configuration or environment variable files if needed (optional for device selection, but GPU-specific variables not required here)  
  3. NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:  
     - Test case for successful loading of default datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, FashionMNIST)  
     - Test case for instantiating default architectures (fc1, LeNet5, AlexNet, VGG16, Resnet18) without errors

     - Test case for successful import and compatibility of all Python dependencies as per requirements.txt (including pandas, seaborn, tensorboardX, tqdm)  
     - Error handling tests: invalid arguments, missing datasets, model initialization failures  
     - Integration test that runs main.py with default parameters end-to-end to verify training and pruning workflow executes without error on CPU  
  4. COMPLETE TODO LIST:  
     1. Install Python 3.7:  
        - Download and install Python 3.7 suitable for Linux x86_64  
        - Verify installation with `python3 --version` returns 3.7.x  
     2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):  
        - Linux/macOS: `python3 -m venv venv` then `source venv/bin/activate`  
     3. Upgrade pip inside virtual environment:  
        - Run `pip install --upgrade pip`  
     4. Clone the project repository or place the project files locally.  
     5. Navigate to the project root directory containing requirements.txt and .gitignore.  
     6. Create the .gitignore file in the project root directory if not already present:  
        - Add the following entries to exclude runtime-generated or large folders:  
          ```
          /data
          /dumps
          /plots
          /runs
          /saves
          ```  
     7. Install Python dependencies from updated requirements.txt with pinned versions:  
        - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
        - Note: Install CPU-only PyTorch 1.2.0 by ensuring no CUDA dependencies are included (default pip install for Linux x86_64 without CUDA)  
        - Verify installations by importing torch, torchvision, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, seaborn, tensorboardX, and tqdm in Python shell without errors.  
     8. **Skip CUDA Toolkit installation** as no NVIDIA GPU is detected and CUDA is not applicable.  
        - Confirm `torch.cuda.is_available()` returns False.  
     9. Run a baseline training test:  
        - Run the example command provided:  
          ```bash  
          python3 main.py --prune_type=lt --arch_type=fc1 --dataset=mnist --prune_percent=10 --prune_iterations=1  
          ```  
        - Verify that training starts, runs without errors on CPU, and outputs logs at specified print frequency  
     10. Verify output files:  
         - Check that weight dumps, plots, runs, and saves directories are created and populated accordingly  
     11. Run combine_plots.py after multiple training runs to verify plotting functionality:  
         - Run `python3 combine_plots.py`  
         - Check `/plots/lt/combined_plots/` for generated graphs  
     12. (Optional) Add and test a new architecture or dataset following README instructions for extensibility  
     13. Implement and run test cases for:  
         - Dataset loading  
         - Model instantiation  
         - Command-line argument parsing  
         - Pruning cycles  
         - CPU usage (since GPU unavailable)  
         - Plot generation  
         - Dependency import and version compatibility (including pandas, seaborn, tensorboardX, tqdm)  
     14. Create documentation or scripts for automated environment setup and testing if required  
     15. Handle errors gracefully:  
         - Verify missing dependencies prompt clear error messages  
         - Validate command-line args and provide usage help if invalid  
         - Capture runtime exceptions during training and pruning  
     16. Document environment setup and usage instructions for team members or deployment  
  Verification Methods:  
  - Use `python3 --version` and `pip list` to verify Python and dependencies version (check pinned versions as per requirements.txt)  
  - Confirm presence and correctness of .gitignore file contents to exclude specified runtime folders  
  - Run test commands and confirm no exceptions or crashes occur  
  - Confirm that `torch.cuda.is_available()` returns False (indicating CPU-only mode)  
  - Validate expected output files and logs are generated  
  - Review plots visually for correctness after running combine_plots.py  
  - Use pytest or unittest frameworks for automated test execution if test cases are implemented  
  ---
  **Summary of key adjustments:**  
  - Target Linux x86_64 architecture confirmed, no ARM or other arch considerations needed.  
  - Omit CUDA Toolkit installation and GPU-specific instructions due to no functional NVIDIA GPU detected.  
  - Install CPU-only PyTorch 1.2.0 binaries compatible with Python 3.7 on Linux x86_64.  
  - Verify GPU detection and disable GPU-related tests if GPU unavailable, switch tests to confirm CPU usage.  
  - Use standard Linux development tools and dependencies.  
  - Paths and directories remain unchanged and suitable for Linux environment.  
  - No changes needed for storage or memory considerations based on provided hardware info.  
  This adjusted plan ensures compatibility and feasibility on your current hardware environment.
NEXT:
  current progress  
  - Base image ubuntu:20.04 is used with non-interactive frontend.  
  - Installed essential system dependencies and development headers.  
  - Downloaded and built Python 3.7.0 from source successfully.  
  - Set python3 and pip3 commands to point to Python 3.7.  
  - Created requirements.txt and .gitignore files with correct pinned versions and entries.  
  - Created a Python virtual environment and activated it via PATH modification.  
  - Upgraded pip inside the virtual environment.  
  - Installed all Python dependencies including CPU-only PyTorch 1.2.0 and torchvision 0.4.0 as specified.  
  - Docker build failed previously due to timeout, likely caused by lengthy Python build or pip installs.  
  next step  
  - Optimize Dockerfile to reduce build time and avoid timeout by:  
    - Using a pre-built Python 3.7 base image (e.g., python:3.7-slim) to skip building Python from source.  
    - Combining apt-get update and install commands to avoid cache issues and reduce layers.  
    - Using pip wheel caching or specifying --no-cache-dir carefully to speed pip installs.  
    - Verifying the installed Python and pip versions explicitly after installation steps.  
  - Add sanity checks to confirm torch.cuda.is_available() returns False during build or runtime tests.  
  - Include a test command or script invocation in Dockerfile or as an additional RUN step to validate environment correctness.  
  - Ensure .gitignore and requirements.txt are copied or created before pip install to optimize Docker cache usage.  
  - Consider splitting the installation steps into smaller RUN commands to isolate errors and improve caching.  
  - After build optimization, rerun Docker build to confirm successful completion within timeout limits.

  - Add entrypoint or CMD to run baseline test command (e.g., `python3 main.py --prune_type=lt ...`) to verify runtime functionality.  
  - Ensure runtime directories (/data, /dumps, /plots, /runs, /saves) are created or mounted as volumes if needed.  
  - Optionally add scripts or commands to run test cases validating dataset loading, model instantiation, pruning, plotting, and CPU-only operation.  
  - Document usage instructions and automate environment setup and tests within container.
