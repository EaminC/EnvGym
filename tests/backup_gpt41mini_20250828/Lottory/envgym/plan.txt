=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:  
   - Python 3.7 (exact version recommended for compatibility)  
     - Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/ or use pyenv/conda for version management  
     - Ensure to install Linux x86_64 compatible Python binaries or build from source if needed  
   - pip (Python package installer) - ensure latest version compatible with Python 3.7  
   - PyTorch 1.2.0 (compatible with Python 3.7)  
     - Since no functional NVIDIA GPU is detected, install the CPU-only version of PyTorch 1.2.0  
     - Use pip installation command without CUDA dependencies as per https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/  
   - torchvision 0.4.0 (compatible with PyTorch 1.2.0)  
   - Git (for cloning the repository and version control)  
   - CUDA Toolkit: **Omit CUDA Toolkit installation** since no NVIDIA GPU is detected and CUDA is not applicable  
   - Additional Python libraries as per requirements.txt (specific versions listed):  
     - cycler==0.10.0  
     - kiwisolver==1.1.0  
     - matplotlib==3.1.1  
     - numpy==1.17.2  
     - pandas==0.25.1  
     - Pillow==6.2.0  
     - protobuf==3.9.2  
     - pyparsing==2.4.2  
     - python-dateutil==2.8.0  
     - pytz==2019.2  
     - scipy==1.3.1  
     - seaborn==0.9.0  
     - six==1.12.0  
     - tensorboardX==1.8  
     - tqdm==4.36.1  
     - torch==1.2.0 (CPU-only build)  
     - torchvision==0.4.0  
   - Additional system dependencies as required by PyTorch, torchvision and other Python packages (e.g., build-essential, python3-dev on Linux)  
     - Since the base image is Linux x86_64 (ubuntu, debian, alpine), use standard Linux build tools and development headers  
     - For example, on Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install build-essential python3-dev git`  

2. FILES TO CREATE:  
   - requirements.txt (updated to include pinned versions as per new file):  
     - Contains the following Python dependencies with exact versions:  
       ```
       cycler==0.10.0  
       kiwisolver==1.1.0  
       matplotlib==3.1.1  
       numpy==1.17.2  
       pandas==0.25.1  
       Pillow==6.2.0  
       protobuf==3.9.2  
       pyparsing==2.4.2  
       python-dateutil==2.8.0  
       pytz==2019.2  
       scipy==1.3.1  
       seaborn==0.9.0  
       six==1.12.0  
       tensorboardX==1.8  
       torch==1.2.0  
       torchvision==0.4.0  
       tqdm==4.36.1  
       ```  
   - .gitignore file (newly added to the plan) to exclude runtime-generated or large data folders:  
     - Contains the following entries:  
       ```
       /data
       /dumps
       /plots
       /runs
       /saves
       ```  
   - (Optional) virtual environment configuration files:  
     - `venv/` directory or conda environment yaml file for reproducible environments  
   - Configuration or environment variable files if needed (optional for device selection, but GPU-specific variables not required here)  

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:  
   - Test case for successful loading of default datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, FashionMNIST)  
   - Test case for instantiating default architectures (fc1, LeNet5, AlexNet, VGG16, Resnet18) without errors  
   - Test case for command-line argument parsing correctness (various pruning types, architectures, datasets, prune percentages, iterations)  
   - Test case for pruning functionality correctness and stability over multiple iterations  
   - Test case for CPU-only device usage since GPU is unavailable (ensure `torch.cuda.is_available()` is False)  
   - Test case for plot generation using combine_plots.py after training runs  
   - Test case for successful import and compatibility of all Python dependencies as per requirements.txt (including pandas, seaborn, tensorboardX, tqdm)  
   - Error handling tests: invalid arguments, missing datasets, model initialization failures  
   - Integration test that runs main.py with default parameters end-to-end to verify training and pruning workflow executes without error on CPU  

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST:  
   1. Install Python 3.7:  
      - Download and install Python 3.7 suitable for Linux x86_64  
      - Verify installation with `python3 --version` returns 3.7.x  
   2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):  
      - Linux/macOS: `python3 -m venv venv` then `source venv/bin/activate`  
   3. Upgrade pip inside virtual environment:  
      - Run `pip install --upgrade pip`  
   4. Clone the project repository or place the project files locally.  
   5. Navigate to the project root directory containing requirements.txt and .gitignore.  
   6. Create the .gitignore file in the project root directory if not already present:  
      - Add the following entries to exclude runtime-generated or large folders:  
        ```
        /data
        /dumps
        /plots
        /runs
        /saves
        ```  
   7. Install Python dependencies from updated requirements.txt with pinned versions:  
      - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
      - Note: Install CPU-only PyTorch 1.2.0 by ensuring no CUDA dependencies are included (default pip install for Linux x86_64 without CUDA)  
      - Verify installations by importing torch, torchvision, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, seaborn, tensorboardX, and tqdm in Python shell without errors.  
   8. **Skip CUDA Toolkit installation** as no NVIDIA GPU is detected and CUDA is not applicable.  
      - Confirm `torch.cuda.is_available()` returns False.  
   9. Run a baseline training test:  
      - Run the example command provided:  
        ```bash  
        python3 main.py --prune_type=lt --arch_type=fc1 --dataset=mnist --prune_percent=10 --prune_iterations=1  
        ```  
      - Verify that training starts, runs without errors on CPU, and outputs logs at specified print frequency  
   10. Verify output files:  
       - Check that weight dumps, plots, runs, and saves directories are created and populated accordingly  
   11. Run combine_plots.py after multiple training runs to verify plotting functionality:  
       - Run `python3 combine_plots.py`  
       - Check `/plots/lt/combined_plots/` for generated graphs  
   12. (Optional) Add and test a new architecture or dataset following README instructions for extensibility  
   13. Implement and run test cases for:  
       - Dataset loading  
       - Model instantiation  
       - Command-line argument parsing  
       - Pruning cycles  
       - CPU usage (since GPU unavailable)  
       - Plot generation  
       - Dependency import and version compatibility (including pandas, seaborn, tensorboardX, tqdm)  
   14. Create documentation or scripts for automated environment setup and testing if required  
   15. Handle errors gracefully:  
       - Verify missing dependencies prompt clear error messages  
       - Validate command-line args and provide usage help if invalid  
       - Capture runtime exceptions during training and pruning  
   16. Document environment setup and usage instructions for team members or deployment  

Verification Methods:  
- Use `python3 --version` and `pip list` to verify Python and dependencies version (check pinned versions as per requirements.txt)  
- Confirm presence and correctness of .gitignore file contents to exclude specified runtime folders  
- Run test commands and confirm no exceptions or crashes occur  
- Confirm that `torch.cuda.is_available()` returns False (indicating CPU-only mode)  
- Validate expected output files and logs are generated  
- Review plots visually for correctness after running combine_plots.py  
- Use pytest or unittest frameworks for automated test execution if test cases are implemented  

---

**Summary of key adjustments:**  
- Target Linux x86_64 architecture confirmed, no ARM or other arch considerations needed.  
- Omit CUDA Toolkit installation and GPU-specific instructions due to no functional NVIDIA GPU detected.  
- Install CPU-only PyTorch 1.2.0 binaries compatible with Python 3.7 on Linux x86_64.  
- Verify GPU detection and disable GPU-related tests if GPU unavailable, switch tests to confirm CPU usage.  
- Use standard Linux development tools and dependencies.  
- Paths and directories remain unchanged and suitable for Linux environment.  
- No changes needed for storage or memory considerations based on provided hardware info.  

This adjusted plan ensures compatibility and feasibility on your current hardware environment.
