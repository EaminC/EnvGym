- Working Directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/Kong_insomnia, project likely Linux-based, no special mounting constraints noted  
- Architecture: x86_64, recommended --platform=linux/amd64  
- Base Image: x86_64 compatible images (e.g., ubuntu, debian, alpine for amd64), no GPU-specific base image required  
- GPU: No NVIDIA GPU detected or driver installed, no CUDA base image recommended  
- Instruction Notes: Use Linux paths, no GPU acceleration instructions needed, storage free space sufficient but monitor usage due to 84.5% usage  
- Docker Version: 28.3.2, supports BuildKit and Docker Buildx, GPU builds unsupported due to missing NVIDIA GPU drivers
