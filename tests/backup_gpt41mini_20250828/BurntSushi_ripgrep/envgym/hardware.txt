- Working Directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/BurntSushi_ripgrep, project likely Linux-based, local path usage relevant for COPY instructions  
- Architecture: x86_64, --platform=linux/amd64 recommended  
- Base Image: x86_64 compatible Linux base images (e.g., ubuntu, debian, alpine x86_64 tags)  
- GPU: No NVIDIA GPU detected, no CUDA base image needed  
- Instruction Notes: Use Linux filesystem paths; no GPU-specific instructions required; leverage overlay2 storage driver compatibility; consider high CPU core count for parallel build steps if applicable  
- Docker Version: 28.3.2, supports BuildKit and docker buildx, GPU build features present but not applicable due to no NVIDIA GPU detected
