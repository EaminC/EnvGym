=== ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN (ADJUSTED FOR x86_64 LINUX ENVIRONMENT) ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:  
   - Rust programming language toolchain, version **1.88.0** or newer (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)  
     - Use Rustup installation on Linux x86_64 architecture.  
   - Cargo package manager (comes with Rust toolchain)  
   - PCRE2 library (optional, for PCRE2 regex support) with pkg-config installed for automatic detection  
     - On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, install via package manager as `libpcre2-dev pkg-config`.  
   - System C compiler (gcc or clang) for building native dependencies and PCRE2, if not already installed  
     - Ensure gcc or clang is installed and accessible in PATH.  
   - Platform-specific ripgrep binaries (optional, if not building from source) from https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases  
   - Optional: MUSL library and musl-gcc (Linux only) for static linking and fully static binary builds  
     - Use `rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` for MUSL target on x86_64 Linux.  
   - Optional: Package managers depending on OS:  
     - Homebrew or Linuxbrew (Linux) can be installed if preferred.  
     - Use native package managers for your Linux distro (e.g., apt-get for Debian/Ubuntu, dnf for Fedora, pacman for Arch Linux).  
   - Additional Rust crate dependencies for development and extension as listed, all compatible with Rust 1.88.0+ and x86_64 Linux.  
   - Windows-specific requirements and manifest linking for MSVC builds are **not applicable** in this Linux environment and should be skipped.  

2. FILES TO CREATE:  
   - Optional ripgrep configuration file `.ripgreprc` or `.rgignore` in user home directory or project root.  
   - Optional Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock for managing Rust dependencies as needed.  
   - Optional shell completion scripts (bash, zsh, fish) for Linux shells; place in standard shell directories.  
   - Optional custom file type definitions if extending filtering.  
   - Optional README or documentation files in crates directories as per development needs.  
   - **Skip creation of Windows-specific files `pkg/windows/README.md` and manifest files**, as they are irrelevant for this Linux environment.  

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:  
   - All tests as specified in original plan apply and are compatible with Linux x86_64 architecture.  
   - Windows-specific tests related to MSVC builds and long path manifests should be omitted or skipped on Linux.  
   - Emphasize running the full test suite (`cargo test --all`) to verify crate functionality and integration on Linux.  
   - Ensure PCRE2 tests run correctly if PCRE2 feature is enabled and library is installed.  
   - Performance and compatibility tests can leverage the high CPU core count available on x86_64 Linux for parallel execution.  

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST (MODIFIED FOR x86_64 LINUX):  
   1. Verify system is Linux x86_64 (confirmed) and has compatible OS and package manager.  
   2. Install Rust toolchain version 1.88.0 or newer via https://rustup.rs for x86_64 Linux.  
      - Verify with `rustc --version` and `cargo --version`.  
   3. (Optional) Install PCRE2 library and pkg-config:  
      - For Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libpcre2-dev pkg-config`  
      - Verify with `pkg-config --modversion libpcre2-8`.  
   4. Install system C compiler if not present:  
      - For Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install build-essential` (includes gcc)  
   5. Clone ripgrep repository and enter directory:  
      - `git clone https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep`  
      - `cd ripgrep`  
   6. Review and update Cargo.toml dependencies if extending or developing:  
      - Confirm or add crates and versions as per original plan.  
   7. **Skip Windows MSVC manifest linking steps; these do not apply on Linux.**  
   8. Build ripgrep from source:  
      - Default build: `cargo build --release`  
      - To enable PCRE2 support: `cargo build --release --features 'pcre2'`  
      - For static MUSL build:  
        - Install MUSL and musl-gcc.  
        - Add MUSL target: `rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`  
        - Build with: `cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`  
   9. Verify build success:  
      - Run `./target/release/rg --version` to confirm version output.  
      - Confirm binary runs correctly on Linux x86_64 environment.  
   10. Optionally install ripgrep via Linux package manager if preferred.  
   11. (Optional) Set up shell completions for bash, zsh, or fish shells on Linux.  
   12. (Optional) Create or customize ripgrep configuration files.  
   13. Run full test suite with `cargo test --all`:  
       - Verify no test failures, including all constituent crates tests and PCRE2 feature tests if enabled.  
       - Skip Windows-specific long path manifest tests.  
   14. (Optional) Write additional tests or extensions as needed.  
   15-24. (Optional) Review documentation files in crates directories; all Linux-compatible.  
   25. Establish usage guidelines and document custom configurations for Linux environment.  
   26. Monitor for updates and patches from official repository as usual.  

VERIFICATION AND ERROR HANDLING NOTES:  
- Use Linux filesystem paths throughout; no Windows path or manifest considerations needed.  
- Ensure all tools (rustc, cargo, gcc, pkg-config) are installed and on PATH.  
- For PCRE2 optional feature, confirm library presence via pkg-config to avoid build errors.  
- Storage and RAM requirements are typical for building Rust projects; no special adjustments needed assuming standard Linux workstation/server class hardware.  
- Leverage Docker BuildKit and buildx with `--platform=linux/amd64` for containerized builds if desired.  
- Skip Windows-only build or manifest steps in scripts or automation to avoid errors.  
- Confirm shell completion scripts are installed to proper locations for Linux shells (e.g., `/etc/bash_completion.d/`, `~/.zsh/completions/`).  
- Confirm no GPU or CUDA dependencies are included due to no NVIDIA GPU detected.  

SUMMARY:  
- The original plan is fully compatible with the x86_64 Linux environment after removing Windows MSVC-specific steps and files.  
- Confirm all Rust and system dependencies are installed via Linux package managers or manual installs.  
- Adjust build and test commands to exclude Windows manifest verification.  
- Use Linux-native paths and shell environments.  
- Use MUSL static builds targeting x86_64-unknown-linux-musl for static binaries if needed.  
- Use docker build with `--platform=linux/amd64` when building in container environments.
