current progress  
- Base Ubuntu 22.04 image with essential system packages installed.  
- Miniconda installed to /home/cc/miniconda3; conda available in PATH.  
- Conda channels configured with conda-forge and strict priority.  
- Attempted to create conda environment flex_r_env with r-base, then install r-eva package; this step failed during docker build.  
- Created Python 3.8 environment flex_py_env and installed required Python packages from requirements.txt.  
- Environment variables R_HOME and PATH updated to include flex_r_env.  
- User cc created and ownership of project files set properly.  
- Shell scripts converted to Unix line endings and permissions set.  
- Final working directory and environment variables set for flex_py_env.

next step  
- Investigate and fix the failure in the RUN command creating flex_r_env and installing r-eva. Possible actions:  
  - Split the RUN command to isolate which step fails (environment creation vs r-eva install).  
  - Add debugging commands (e.g., conda list, conda info) inside the Dockerfile after environment creation.  
  - Confirm network connectivity and conda channel access inside the build context.  
  - Try creating flex_r_env with both r-base and r-eva in one conda create command to avoid separate install step.  
  - Ensure conda activation or environment variables are correctly set for the install step.  
- Once fixed, re-test docker build to confirm success of R environment setup.  
- Consider adding explicit installation of R dependencies or pinning package versions if needed.  
- Verify that environment variables for R_HOME and PATH are correctly set for both build and runtime.
