- JAVA_HOME and PATH configured for GraalVM, but GraalVM itself not installed due to failed download.  
- Native-image tool installation step present but not reached successfully because of failed GraalVM download.  

next step  
- Verify the correct, existing GraalVM release URL for version 22.3.4 (or consider updating to a newer stable version) on GitHub GraalVM CE releases page.  
- Update the GRAALVM_URL environment variable in the Dockerfile to point to a valid downloadable GraalVM tarball for amd64 Linux.  
- Rebuild the image to confirm successful GraalVM download and extraction.  
- Proceed with native-image tool installation and validation after successful GraalVM installation.
