current progress  
- Docker image builds and runs successfully with Ubuntu 22.04 base (no explicit platform flag yet)  
- Essential packages including Java 8, Maven, Git, Firefox, GeckoDriver installed correctly  
- Miniforge (Conda) installed at /opt/conda, conda environment setup script executed, environment created  
- User itdocker added with sudo privileges, working directory and ownership set properly  
- Source code copied into container with correct ownership  
- Conda environment activation and pip install of exli package performed inside container  
- Directories for logs, results, and tests created with correct permissions  
- Dockerfile commands align mostly with plan except missing explicit `--platform=linux/amd64` in FROM and build command  

next step  
- Modify Dockerfile to specify platform explicitly in the FROM line as `FROM --platform=linux/amd64 ubuntu:22.04` to ensure architecture consistency  
- Update Docker build command to include `--platform=linux/amd64` flag  
- Confirm that Conda environment activation uses the correct environment name consistently (`exli`) in all RUN commands (currently base is activated before prepare-conda-env.sh)  
- Ensure `prepare-conda-env.sh` installs all dependencies from setup.py including extras if needed  
- Validate network access during build for cloning repos if applicable (currently code copied instead)  
- Test full environment activation and package imports in final image shell to confirm no errors  
- Verify that volume mappings and directory permissions work correctly during container runtime  
- Add any missing steps from plan such as cloning `inlinetest` repo if required during build
