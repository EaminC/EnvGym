current progress  
- Base Ubuntu 22.04 image with essential build tools and utilities installed (make, git, curl, fd-find, fzf, ripgrep, tree, parallel, rofi)  
- Rust 1.77.2 installed via rustup with rustfmt component added  
- Symlink created for fd binary to support Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora naming (`fdfind` â†’ `fd`) in `/root/.local/bin`  
- Working directory set to `/fd` with source code copied in  
- Empty rustfmt.toml file created in root  
- Cargo install run to build and install fd from source path  
- Ignore files `.fdignore` and config directory `/root/.config/fd/ignore` created as empty files  
- Environment variables and aliases for fzf and fd configured in `/root/.bashrc`  
- LS_COLORS setup via dircolors and appended to bashrc  
- Dockerfile shell set to bash and default CMD to bash  

next step  
- Add a step to run `cargo fmt -- --check` or `rustfmt --check` to verify code formatting adherence before installation  
- Add `cargo test` execution after build to verify code integrity and run all test cases on x86_64 Linux environment  
- Ensure `/root/.local/bin` is added to PATH in shell config explicitly (currently only appended in ENV, verify functional)  
- Optionally create `.fdignore` and `/root/.config/fd/ignore` with meaningful ignore patterns instead of empty files  
- Document in the Dockerfile comments the omission of cross-compilation setup and ARM-specific configurations as per plan  
- Confirm that aliases set in `.bashrc` will be available in non-interactive shells or add equivalent ENV variables if needed  
- Optionally add verification commands (e.g., `fd --version`, pipe to fzf) as test RUN steps to validate integration  
- Clean up any unnecessary files after build to minimize image size if desired
