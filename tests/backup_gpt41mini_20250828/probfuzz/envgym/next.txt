current progress  
- Docker image built successfully on Ubuntu 22.04 base with required system packages installed.  
- Project files copied into /app directory and install.sh script made executable and run (with errors ignored).  
- Python virtual environment created at /app/venv and PATH updated accordingly.  
- pip upgraded inside venv.  
- Key Python dependencies installed explicitly with CPU-only versions for tensorflow and torch, plus edward2 and pyro-ppl.  
- Output directory created with root ownership.  
- Docker container runtime starts with bash shell successfully.  

next step  
- Modify Dockerfile to create and activate the Python virtual environment before running install.sh to ensure dependencies install inside venv.  
- Remove or avoid running install.sh twice; consolidate dependency installation steps to avoid redundant or conflicting installs.  
- Ensure install.sh does not attempt GPU or CUDA installs and aligns with Dockerfile pip installs for CPU-only packages.  
- Change ownership of /app/output to a non-root user or the user running the container to avoid permission issues.  
- Add explicit user creation and switch to non-root user for safer container execution.  
- Validate config.json paths and python executable point to /app/venv/bin/python inside container.  
- Add health checks or test commands in Dockerfile to verify successful installation and environment correctness at build time.
