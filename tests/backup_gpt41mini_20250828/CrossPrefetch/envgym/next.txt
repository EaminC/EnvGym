current progress

- Dockerfile uses the correct Ubuntu 22.04 base image suitable for x86_64 CPU.
- All operations and paths are relative to the specified working directory `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/CrossPrefetch`.
- No GPU or CUDA related packages, environment variables, or build arguments are present.
- Essential build tools and dependencies compatible with CPU-only builds are installed.
- Project files are copied correctly into the container.
- Python dependencies installation is conditionally handled.
- Build commands use all available CPU cores (`make -j$(nproc)` or cmake equivalent).
- Entrypoint and working directory are set correctly.
- Docker build and runtime succeeded according to the logs.

next step

- Verify that all project dependencies and build commands fully support CPU-only execution without GPU assumptions.
- Confirm and test that any scripts or documentation inside the project reflect the CPU-only environment and parallel build usage.
- Optionally, optimize Dockerfile by cleaning up build cache or layers to reduce image size if necessary.
- Add explicit platform specification (`--platform=linux/amd64`) in Docker build and run commands outside the Dockerfile as per adjusted plan.
- Validate runtime behavior inside the container to ensure no residual GPU dependencies or environment variables remain.
- Update README or developer documentation to emphasize CPU-only configuration and build instructions.
