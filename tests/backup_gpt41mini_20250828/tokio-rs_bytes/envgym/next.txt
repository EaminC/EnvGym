current progress  
- Base Ubuntu 22.04 image with essential build tools and dependencies installed.  
- Rust stable toolchain installed via rustup, nightly toolchain installed.  
- User `cc` created and ownership set properly.  
- Project files copied with correct ownership.  
- Clippy MSRV config and `.cargo/config.toml` for docsrs cfg set up.  
- Network connectivity to crates.io tested and confirmed.  
- Cargo lockfile generated, metadata and update commands run successfully.  
- `cargo fetch` command failed during build, causing build failure.  
- Subsequent cargo commands (`check`, `build`, `test`, `clippy`) not reached due to fetch failure.

next step  
- Investigate `cargo fetch` failure cause by examining network, proxy, or crates.io access issues during build.  
- Add verbose logs or retry logic around `cargo fetch` to capture detailed error messages.  
- Confirm Cargo.toml correctness and presence of all dependencies to avoid resolution errors.  
- Verify DNS and firewall settings within Docker environment to ensure uninterrupted crates.io access.  
- Optionally add `cargo clean` before fetch to clear any corrupted state.  
- After fixing fetch, continue with `cargo check`, `cargo build`, `cargo test`, and `cargo clippy` steps.  
- Consider adding explicit rustup component installs like `rustfmt` and `clippy` if missing.  
- Ensure Docker build does not timeout or lose network connection during fetch.
