=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

**Note:** This plan is adjusted to your hardware context: x86_64 architecture (amd64 Linux), no GPU present, Docker version 28.3.2, working directory `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/acto`, and standard Linux amd64 base images. All instructions and tooling are aligned accordingly.

---

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:  
   - **Docker**  
     - Use latest stable Docker version (you have 28.3.2 installed, which supports BuildKit and modern features).  
     - Use amd64 Linux base images only (e.g., `ubuntu:20.04`, `debian:stable-amd64`, `alpine:3.18-amd64`). Avoid ARM or other architectures.  
     - No GPU or CUDA images are needed or applicable due to absence of NVIDIA GPU.  
     - Verify with:  
       ```bash  
       docker --version  
       docker run --platform=linux/amd64 hello-world  
       ```  
     - Use `--platform=linux/amd64` explicitly in Docker commands if multi-arch images are encountered to ensure amd64 images are selected.  
   
   - **Golang**  
     - Install Go 1.20+ (latest stable) for amd64 Linux.  
     - Use official Go installers or package manager binaries built for amd64 Linux.  
     - Set `GOPATH` and ensure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your PATH.  
     - Install Kind v0.20.0 via:  
       ```bash  
       GOARCH=amd64 GOOS=linux go install sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.20.0  
       ```  
       or simply:  
       ```bash  
       go install sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.20.0  
       ```  
       since your host is amd64 Linux.  
     - Verify with: `kind version`  
   
   - **Kind (Kubernetes in Docker)**  
     - Use version v0.20.0 as specified.  
     - Ensure Kind binary is accessible in PATH (`$GOPATH/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`).  
   
   - **Python**  
     - Runtime requires Python 3.12+ (amd64 Linux binaries).  
     - Development environment requires at least Python 3.10+.  
     - On older systems (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 with Python 3.8), manually install Python 3.10+ for dev environment.  
     - Use system package manager or official Python amd64 Linux installers.  
     - Verify with `python3 --version` or inside virtual environment.  
   
   - **Python dependencies**  
     - Use pinned `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` generated with Python 3.12+ on amd64 Linux.  
     - Use `pip-compile` from `pip-tools` installed inside Python 3.12+ venv or system environment.  
     - Development tooling includes black, isort, pylint, mypy (optional), pre-commit, etc.  
     - Ensure all wheels and binary dependencies are compatible with amd64 Linux.  
   
   - **kubectl**  
     - Install latest stable kubectl client for amd64 Linux.  
     - Verify with `kubectl version --client`  
   
   - **Helm (optional)**  
     - Use Helm binaries for amd64 Linux if deploying operators with Helm charts.  
     - Verify with `helm version`  
   
   - **Make tool**  
     - Ensure GNU Make or compatible version installed on amd64 Linux host.  
     - Verify with `make --version`  
   
   - **Pre-commit**  
     - Install via pip inside Python environment (amd64 Linux).  
     - Verify with `pre-commit --version`  
   
   - **Ansible**  
     - Install via pip on amd64 Linux.  
     - Install required collections: `ansible.posix` and `community.general` compatible with your Ansible Core 2.17.5.  
     - Verify with `ansible --version` and `ansible-playbook --version`  
   
   - **Golang code coverage tools**  
     - Install `gocovmerge` for amd64 Linux environment via:  
       ```bash  
       GOARCH=amd64 GOOS=linux go install github.com/wadey/gocovmerge@latest  
       ```  
     - Modify Dockerfiles and shell scripts as described for coverage measurement on amd64 Linux containers.  
   
   - **System kernel parameters (inotify limits)**  
     - Apply sysctl settings on your amd64 Linux host before multi-worker Kind cluster creation as described.  
     - These settings are architecture-independent but ensure your Linux kernel supports these sysctl parameters.  

---

2. FILES TO CREATE:  
   - All files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `requirements-dev.txt`, `Makefile`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, operator deployment scripts, config files, test data, documentation files, Ansible inventory and playbooks) remain as specified.  
   - Ensure all file paths and references within the config files and manifests are relative to your project root `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/acto` or absolute as needed, consistent with your working directory.  
   - For Docker and Kind related configs, confirm volume mount paths align with your project directory structure and host OS (amd64 Linux).  
   - No changes needed for file formats or contents due to hardware; all remain compatible with amd64 Linux.  

---

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:  
   - All test cases remain valid and applicable.  
   - Tests involving binary execution, coverage, and container orchestration run on amd64 Linux architecture.  
   - No ARM-specific test cases or GPU-accelerated tests are present or required.  
   - For tests involving Docker images, ensure images are amd64 variants or multi-arch images with amd64 manifest support.  
   - Verify that tests depending on system limits or kernel features are run on compatible amd64 Linux kernel (typical for your environment).

**Verification and Validation Notes:**  
- All binaries, Docker images, tools, and dependencies must be amd64 Linux compatible.  
- Use `--platform=linux/amd64` explicitly in Docker commands when needed to avoid accidental ARM or other arch pulls.  
- Confirm all paths in configs and mounts correspond to your actual project root `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/acto`.  
- Validate Python virtual environments and Ansible setups target amd64 Linux hosts.  
- No GPU or CUDA considerations apply; skip any GPU-related steps or tooling.  
- Ensure Linux kernel on amd64 host supports required sysctl parameters (typical for modern Linux).
