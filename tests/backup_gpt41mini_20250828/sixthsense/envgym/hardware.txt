- Working Directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/sixthsense; project likely located within a multi-level user directory, no special volume mounting constraints indicated  
- Architecture: x86_64; recommended --platform=linux/amd64  
- Base Image: use amd64-compatible Linux base images (e.g., ubuntu, debian, alpine for amd64); no ARM or other architecture needed  
- GPU: No NVIDIA GPU detected; no CUDA base image required or recommended  
- Instruction Notes: no GPU-specific instructions needed; large CPU cores available allow parallel build steps; use overlay2 storage driver compatibility; ensure Dockerfile paths relative to /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/sixthsense  
- Docker Version: 28.3.2; supports BuildKit and Buildx; GPU build support present but irrelevant due to no NVIDIA GPU; use Docker Compose v2.38.2 for multi-container orchestration
