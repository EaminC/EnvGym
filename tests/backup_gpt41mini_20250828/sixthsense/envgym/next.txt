current progress  
- Base image Ubuntu 18.04 set and system dependencies installed.  
- Miniconda Python 3.8 installed and conda initialized.  
- Project root directory and necessary subdirectories (`plots`, `models`, `results`, `csvs`, `subcategories`) created.  
- `requirements.txt` and `sixthsense_env.yml` files created with correct contents.  
- Conda environment `sixthsense` created with Python 3.8; pip packages installed from `requirements.txt`.  
- Conda environment activation configured in bash shell and environment variables set.  
- SixthSense repository cloning step noted but not implemented (commented out).  
- Default CMD set to bash shell.  

next step  
- Add actual cloning or copying of SixthSense codebase into `${PROJECT_ROOT}` (replace placeholder `[repository_url]` with real URL or mount code).  
- Add commands to download and place the CSV dataset files from Zenodo into the `csvs/` folder inside the container or provide instructions for mounting.  
- Verify presence or copy of `subcategories` JSON files inside the container.  
- Optionally add `.gitignore` creation if managing source code inside container.  
- Add validation steps or scripts to test package imports and basic script execution inside the container.  
- Consider adding entrypoint or default commands to run training scripts or tests automatically if desired.
