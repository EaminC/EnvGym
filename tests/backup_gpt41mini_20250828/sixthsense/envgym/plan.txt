=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:  
   - Python 3.6 or higher (recommend Python 3.8+ for better support and compatibility with listed packages)  
   - Conda (Anaconda or Miniconda) for environment management (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)  
   - pip (should come with Python/Conda)  
   - Git (to clone the repository if not already done)  
   - CSV datasets from Zenodo: Download csv files from https://zenodo.org/record/6388301 and place them in the `csvs` folder  
   - Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit recommended for best compatibility; alternatives (Windows, macOS) possible but verify dependencies and Python compatibility  
     *Note: Your hardware is x86_64 architecture and running Linux, so Ubuntu 18.04 or later 64-bit is fully compatible.*  
   - Key Python packages as per `requirements.txt` (to be installed via pip):  
     - scikit-learn  
     - numpy  
     - matplotlib  
     - pandas  
     - jsonpickle  
     - nearpy  
     - treeinterpreter  
     - cleanlab  
   - Verify package compatibility with Python version (prefer Python 3.8+ to ensure smooth installs and up-to-date package support)  

2. FILES TO CREATE:  
   - Conda environment YAML file (e.g., `sixthsense_env.yml`) updated to include Python 3.8 and pip installation of `requirements.txt`:  
     ```yaml
     name: sixthsense
     channels:
       - defaults
     dependencies:
       - python=3.8
       - pip
       - pip:
         - -r requirements.txt  # installs all required Python dependencies
     ```  
   - `requirements.txt` file containing:  
     ```
     scikit-learn
     numpy
     matplotlib
     pandas
     jsonpickle
     nearpy
     treeinterpreter
     cleanlab
     ```  
   - Directory structure inside `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/sixthsense`:  
     - `plots/` (for saving output plots)  
     - `models/` (for saving model files)  
     - `results/` (for saving prediction scores and results)  
     - `csvs/` (place the downloaded CSV datasets here)  
     - `subcategories/` (should contain JSON files defining model names per class, ensure this folder exists)  
     *Note: Paths are relative to your project root `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/sixthsense`.*  
   - Optional: create a `.gitignore` to exclude large or generated files such as `plots/`, `models/`, and `results/`  

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:  
   - Test loading and parsing of feature CSV files (`csvs/[classname]_features.csv`)  
   - Test loading and parsing of metrics CSV files (`csvs/[classname]_metrics.csv`)  
   - Test training script (`train.py`) runs without error given correct parameters for all three model classes (`lrm`, `timeseries`, `mixture`)  
   - Test command-line argument parsing and validation, especially for required flags (`-f`, `-l`, `-a`, `-m`, `-tname`)  
   - Test output generation: verify plots are created under `plots/` and results saved in `results/`  
   - Verify cross-validation and model splitting logic (`-cv` and `-st` options)  
   - Test feature importance extraction with `--tree` and `--special` flags for a valid program index  
   - Test error handling for missing files, invalid parameter values, and unsupported ML algorithm options  
   - Test runtime and warmup sampling flags (`-runtime`, `-warmup`) for proper feature usage  
   - Test installation and import of all packages listed in `requirements.txt` to ensure environment completeness and compatibility  
   - Test functionality dependent on newly added packages such as:  
     - `cleanlab` (for label error detection and correction)  
     - `nearpy` (for approximate nearest neighbor operations, if used in code)  
     - `treeinterpreter` (for interpreting tree-based model predictions)  
     - `jsonpickle` (for JSON serialization/deserialization beyond standard json)  

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST:  

   Step 1: Install Conda environment manager  
   - Download and install Miniconda or Anaconda for your OS and architecture (x86_64 Linux)  
   - Verify installation by running `conda --version`  

   Step 2: Clone or download the SixthSense repository  
   - `git clone [repository_url]` or download ZIP and extract into `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/sixthsense`  
   - Navigate to the project root directory:  
     ```
     cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/sixthsense
     ```  

   Step 3: Create required directories  
   - Run:  
     ```
     mkdir -p plots models results csvs subcategories
     ```  
   - Verify directories exist and are writable (no special volume mounting or permission issues indicated)  

   Step 4: Download dataset CSV files  
   - Download CSV files from https://zenodo.org/record/6388301  
   - Place all CSV files into the `csvs/` directory  
   - Verify presence of `[classname]_features.csv` and `[classname]_metrics.csv` for each model class (`lrm`, `timeseries`, `mixture`)  

   Step 5: Verify presence of `subcategories` JSON files  
   - Ensure JSON files named `[classname].json` exist inside the `subcategories/` folder  
   - These define model names needed for training and predictions  

   Step 6: Prepare `requirements.txt` file  
   - Create or update `requirements.txt` in project root containing:  
     ```
     scikit-learn
     numpy
     matplotlib
     pandas
     jsonpickle
     nearpy
     treeinterpreter
     cleanlab
     ```  

   Step 7: Create and activate the Conda environment  
   - Use the provided `sixthsense_env.yml` or create manually:  
     ```
     conda create -n sixthsense python=3.8
     conda activate sixthsense
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```  
   - Verify Python version:  
     ```
     python --version
     ```  
     Should output Python 3.8.x or higher  
   - Verify all dependencies installed without errors by checking pip or conda logs  
   - Test importing all key packages in a Python shell:  
     ```python
     import sklearn
     import numpy
     import matplotlib
     import pandas
     import jsonpickle
     import nearpy
     import treeinterpreter
     import cleanlab
     ```  
     Should not raise ImportError  

   Step 8: Test basic script execution  
   - Run a simple training command example (replace placeholders accordingly):  
     ```
     python train.py -f csvs/lrm_features.csv -l csvs/lrm_metrics.csv -a rf -m rhat_min -suf avg -bw -plt -saveas plots/results_rhat_min_lrm.png -keep _ast_ dt_ var_min var_max data_size -st -tname naive-bayes-unsup -cv -ignore_vi
     ```  
   - Verify script runs without errors and outputs are generated in `plots/` and `results/` folders  
   - Check console output for prediction scores  

   Step 9: Test feature importance extraction  
   - Run command to get top features:  
     ```
     python train.py -f csvs/lrm_features.csv -l csvs/lrm_metrics.csv -a rf -m rhat_min -suf avg -bw -th 1.1 -saveas plots/temp.png -keep _ast_ dt_ var_min var_max data_size -st -tname naive-bayes-unsup -ignore_vi --tree -special progs20200425-172437571193_prob_rand_7
     ```  
   - Verify output of top 20 features and their scores  

   Step 10: Adjust sampling/warmup iterations if needed  
   - Modify lines ~730-740 in `train.py` to change runtime/warmup iteration counts if desired  
   - Test runtime and warmup training modes using flags `-runtime` and `-warmup` as per README instructions  

   Step 11: Add error handling and verification steps  
   - Confirm the scripts handle missing or corrupted CSV files gracefully  
   - Validate command-line argument errors produce informative messages  
   - Verify directory permissions and create missing directories automatically if possible  

   Step 12: Document environment setup and usage  
   - Create a `SETUP.md` or update `README.md` with environment creation instructions  
   - Include instructions for running training commands and feature importance analysis  
   - Document the purpose of each dependency listed in `requirements.txt`  

   Step 13: Optional - Setup automated tests for the above test cases  
   - Write unit/integration tests using pytest or unittest frameworks  
   - Automate environment verification and script execution tests  

5. HARDWARE & SYSTEM-SPECIFIC NOTES:  
   - Architecture: x86_64 Linux confirmed; no ARM or other architecture concerns  
   - GPU: No NVIDIA GPU detected; no CUDA or GPU-specific dependencies needed or recommended  
   - Docker: If containerizing, use amd64-compatible Linux base images (e.g., ubuntu:18.04 or later, debian) without GPU support  
   - Parallel build steps and CPU cores available can speed up installation and testing  
   - Overlay2 storage driver is compatible, no special Docker storage adjustments needed  
   - All paths and directories assume no special volume mounts and are relative to `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/sixthsense`  
   - RAM and storage considerations:  
     - Python environment with above dependencies is moderate in size; ensure at least 4 GB RAM available for smooth operation  
     - Dataset CSV files and output directories should have sufficient disk space (a few hundred MBs at least)  
   - Development tools: Conda version and Docker version are recent and compatible; no adjustments needed  
   - Permissions: Ensure the user has read/write permissions in the working directory and all created folders  

6. VERIFICATION METHODS:  
   - Confirm Python version is 3.8+ with:  
     ```
     python --version
     ```  
   - Check all dependencies installed without errors:  
     ```
     pip list
     ```  
   - Test importing all packages in a Python shell to confirm no ImportErrors  
   - Run example training commands and verify output files exist and contain data in `plots/` and `results/`  
   - Confirm no runtime errors or exceptions during script runs  
   - Check logs and console output for warnings or errors  
   - Validate feature importance outputs match expected format and values  
   - Verify error handling for missing/invalid inputs by purposely triggering errors  
   - Confirm smooth operation on x86_64 Linux without GPU dependencies  

This adjusted plan aligns fully with your hardware environment and paths, ensuring compatibility and smooth setup and operation.
