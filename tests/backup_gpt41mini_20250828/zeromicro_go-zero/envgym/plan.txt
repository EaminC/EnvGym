Adjusted Plan:

1. Base Image Selection:
   - Use an amd64-compatible base image, such as `golang:1.20-amd64` or `ubuntu:22.04` (amd64), to ensure compatibility with the x86_64 architecture.
   - Avoid any ARM or other architecture-specific images.

2. Docker Build Configuration:
   - Specify the platform explicitly in the Docker build command to ensure amd64 target:
     ```
     docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t your-image-name .
     ```
   - Enable BuildKit for efficient builds (already supported in Docker 28.3.2).

3. GPU and CUDA:
   - Since no NVIDIA GPU is detected, do not include any CUDA or GPU-specific base images or dependencies.
   - Omit any GPU-related environment variables or runtime flags.

4. Storage and Cgroup Drivers:
   - Ensure the Docker daemon uses the overlay2 storage driver for compatibility.
   - Be aware of systemd cgroup driver usage; configure the container and host accordingly if systemd cgroups are in use.

5. Working Directory and Paths:
   - Set the working directory inside the Dockerfile to `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/zeromicro_go-zero`:
     ```
     WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/zeromicro_go-zero
     ```
   - Confirm all project files and dependencies are copied or mounted appropriately relative to this directory.

6. Development Tools and Versions:
   - Use Go version consistent with the project requirements (e.g., Go 1.20) matching the base image's Go version.
   - Install any additional build tools or dependencies compatible with amd64 and Ubuntu/Debian if using those base images.

7. Memory and Storage:
   - Verify host system has sufficient RAM and disk space for the build and runtime processes.
   - No specific adjustments needed in the plan unless project demands exceed host capacity.

8. Operating System Compatibility:
   - Use base images aligned with Linux distributions compatible with x86_64, such as Ubuntu or Debian.
   - Avoid Windows or non-Linux base images.

Summary:
- Use amd64 base images and specify `--platform=linux/amd64` in docker build commands.
- Remove GPU/CUDA-related components.
- Set working directory correctly.
- Ensure storage driver and cgroup driver compatibility.
- Confirm development tools align with amd64 architecture.

This adjusted plan ensures compatibility and efficient use of the hardware environment described.
