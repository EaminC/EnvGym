Adjusted Environment Setup Plan:

1. Base Image Selection
- Use a Linux AMD64 compatible base image to align with the x86_64 architecture.
- Recommended base image: node:alpine (latest tag) for a lightweight Node.js environment suitable for Express.js projects.
- Alternatively, ubuntu:22.04 can be used if additional system tools are required.

2. Dockerfile Configuration
- Set the platform explicitly to linux/amd64 in the Dockerfile or Docker build command to ensure architecture compatibility:
  docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t your-image-name .
- Utilize multi-stage builds leveraging the available large memory to optimize image size without memory constraints.

3. Storage Driver Compatibility
- Ensure Docker daemon is configured to use overlay2 storage driver.
- Use standard Dockerfile instructions compatible with overlay2; no special adjustments needed.

4. Project Directory and Paths
- Set the working directory inside the container to /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/expressjs_express to reflect the current project structure.
- Copy package.json and package-lock.json first for dependency installation caching.
- Copy the rest of the source code afterward.

5. Node.js and Dependencies
- Use Node.js version matching the base image (node:alpine latest is currently Node.js 20.x or latest stable).
- Run npm install (or yarn install if preferred) inside the container after copying package files.
- No GPU-specific dependencies or CUDA libraries required.

6. Build and Runtime Instructions
- Use BuildKit and Docker Buildx features supported by Docker version 28.3.2 for efficient builds.
- Avoid any GPU build instructions as no NVIDIA GPU is detected.
- Use typical Node.js environment variables and ports (e.g., ENV PORT=3000).

7. Memory and Storage
- No memory constraints; multi-stage builds for cleaner images are recommended.
- Monitor image size but no special storage space limitations apply.

8. Final Dockerfile Example Snippet:

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM --platform=linux/amd64 node:alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/expressjs_express

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

# Optionally build or transpile if needed here

FROM --platform=linux/amd64 node:alpine

WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/expressjs_express

COPY --from=builder /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/expressjs_express .

ENV PORT=3000

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

Summary:
- Explicitly set platform to linux/amd64.
- Use node:alpine base image for compatibility and lightweight build.
- Align working directory with given path.
- No GPU or CUDA related steps.
- Leverage multi-stage builds with no memory constraints.
- Use overlay2 compatible instructions.
