current progress  
- Docker build and runtime completed successfully using the specified Dockerfile.  
- Dockerfile follows the multi-stage build approach with linux/amd64 platform explicitly set.  
- Base image node:alpine used as planned.  
- Working directory aligned with the specified project path.  
- Dependencies installed in the builder stage caching package.json files.  
- Runtime stage adds bash via apk and sets working directory and environment variables correctly.  

next step  
- Modify CMD to run the Node.js application instead of launching bash, e.g., `CMD ["node", "app.js"]`.  
- Confirm that `app.js` exists and is the correct entry point for the Express.js app.  
- Optionally remove bash installation if not required for runtime to keep image minimal.  
- Validate runtime environment variables and exposed ports align with app configuration.
