current progress  
- Base image set to Ubuntu 22.04 with environment variables configured.  
- Core packages and dependencies installed including python3.10, qemu-system-x86, clang-15, llvm-15, build-essential, and utilities aligned with the adjusted plan.  
- Python3.10 set as default python interpreter and verified required modules (ctypes, readline).  
- Silhouette and PMFS repositories cloned into expected directory structure.  
- Executable permissions set on key scripts where possible.  
- Deferred running of install_dep.sh, prepare.sh, and build commands to runtime to avoid build timeouts.  
- Instructions for manual download of large guest VM image included.  
- Default command set to open bash shell in Silhouette root directory.  

next step  
- Automate or script the execution of `install_dep.sh` and `prepare.sh` at container runtime or via an entrypoint script to streamline environment preparation.  
- Add steps to build tools inside `codebase/tools` automatically or via a helper script after dependencies are installed.  
- Incorporate verification or checks for sufficient disk space and resources within the container or documented usage instructions.  
- Provide clear mounting or volume instructions for the large guest VM image to be accessible inside the container.  
- Optionally, add user and permission management to avoid running as root inside the container for better security and compatibility.  
- Consider adding health checks or test scripts for VM startup and SSH connectivity to validate container readiness.
