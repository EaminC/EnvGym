- Working Directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/Silhouette, project under user home with typical Linux path structure  
- Architecture: x86_64, recommended --platform=linux/amd64  
- Base Image: x86_64 compatible images (e.g., ubuntu, debian, alpine for amd64), no GPU-specific base image required  
- GPU: No NVIDIA GPU detected, no CUDA base image required  
- Instruction Notes: Use standard Linux paths, no GPU acceleration instructions needed, consider large number of CPU cores for parallel build steps (e.g., make -j96)  
- Docker Version: 28.3.2, supports BuildKit and docker buildx, GPU build support present but not applicable here due to lack of NVIDIA GPU
