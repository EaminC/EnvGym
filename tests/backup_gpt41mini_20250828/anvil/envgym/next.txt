current progress
- Base image set to ubuntu:22.04 with explicit platform linux/amd64
- Rust 1.88.0 installed via rustup with rust-src component added
- System dependencies and Python tabulate package installed
- Workspace set to /workspace and project files copied
- Network connectivity to github.com and crates.io verified
- Cargo environment variables set for retries and timeouts
- Cargo update commands executed (some with ignore errors)
- Cargo fetch command failed during build with exit code 1, preventing further progress to cargo check and build steps

next step
- Investigate cause of cargo fetch failure by examining /workspace/cargo_fetch.log output in Docker build context
- Verify Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock files are present, valid, and not corrupted in the build context
- Ensure network access from Docker build context is unrestricted (proxy or firewall issues)
- Simplify Dockerfile by combining cargo update and fetch steps, adding more verbose logging or retry logic
- Consider running cargo fetch outside Docker or with minimal dependencies to isolate issue
- Add explicit Cargo.lock copying and verify permissions to avoid fetch failures
- Update Dockerfile RUN commands to fail immediately on errors to catch issues early
- Once cargo fetch succeeds, proceed to cargo check and build commands with proper error handling
