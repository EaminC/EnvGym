- Architecture: x86_64, recommended --platform=linux/amd64
- Base Image: Use x86_64 Linux base images (e.g., ubuntu, debian, alpine) compatible with amd64 architecture
- GPU: No NVIDIA GPU detected, no CUDA base image recommended
- Instruction Notes: No GPU-specific instructions needed; consider overlay2 storage driver optimizations; large memory available allows for heavier builds; no special AppArmor or seccomp adjustments required
- Docker Version: 28.3.2, supports BuildKit and docker buildx; GPU build features not applicable due to lack of NVIDIA GPU
