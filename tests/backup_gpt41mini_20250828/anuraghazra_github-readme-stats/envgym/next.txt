current progress
- Dockerfile uses linux/amd64 base images explicitly with python:3.11-slim-bullseye.
- Multi-stage build implemented with a builder stage and final runtime stage.
- COPY commands are relative and consistent with the working directory /app.
- Apt packages installed without GPU or CUDA dependencies.
- Dockerfile syntax version 1.4 used, compatible with Docker 28.3.2 features.
- No GPU-specific flags or instructions present.
- Build and runtime logs indicate successful build and execution.

next step
- Adjust all paths and working directory references to match the specified /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/anuraghazra_github-readme-stats directory instead of /app.
- Optimize use of overlay2 storage features by minimizing layer count and cleaning up cache or intermediate files after installs.
- Verify and explicitly specify `--platform=linux/amd64` in docker build commands during build execution if not already done.
- Confirm that all installed tools and binaries are fully compatible with x86_64 and do not require GPU acceleration.
- Consider adding explicit image size monitoring and cleanup steps to reduce final image size further.
- Remove unnecessary npm environment variables like HUSKY=0 if not used or relevant.
