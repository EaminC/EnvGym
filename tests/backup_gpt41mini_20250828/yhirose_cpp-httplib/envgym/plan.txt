=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:  
   - C++ Compiler with C++11 support or higher (e.g., GCC 5.0+, Clang 3.4+, MSVC latest Visual Studio)  
     - Note: For Docker static server build, GCC with C++23 support is required (e.g., GCC 11+).  
     - GCC 4.8 and below are not supported due to broken `<regex>` support.  
     - Ensure the compiler targets x86_64 architecture to match the host and Docker base image.  
   - OpenSSL 3.0 or later (for SSL/TLS support)  
   - zlib (for gzip compression support)  
   - Brotli library (optional, for Brotli compression support) - https://github.com/google/brotli  
   - Zstd library (optional, for Zstd compression support) - https://github.com/facebook/zstd  
   - Docker (version 28.3.2 confirmed, supports BuildKit and Buildx)  
     - Use overlay2 storage driver compatible instructions as recommended.  
   - Docker Compose (optional, to orchestrate container services via `docker-compose.yml`)  
   - CMake or other build system (optional, depending on project build setup)  
   - clang-format tool (version v18.1.8 recommended) for code formatting and style enforcement via pre-commit hook  
     - Can be installed via package manager or used via pre-commit-managed binary  
   - On macOS: CoreFoundation and Security frameworks (for system certs support)  
   - For Unix Domain Socket support: Linux or macOS environment (Windows currently unsupported)  
   - Python (required to run pre-commit framework and hooks)  
   - pre-commit framework (to manage git hooks, installable via `pip install pre-commit`)  

2. FILES TO CREATE:  
   - `httplib.h` and optionally split into `httplib.h` and `httplib.cc` using the `split.py` script (available with the project)  
   - SSL certificates and private keys for HTTPS server (e.g., `cert.pem` and `key.pem`) if SSL support is enabled  
   - CA bundle file (e.g., `ca-bundle.crt`) if custom certificate verification is needed  
   - Dockerfile(s) for containerized static HTTP server(s):  
     - Use x86_64 compatible base images recommended for compatibility with host architecture.  
     - Prefer official Ubuntu 22.04 or Debian-based images matching the host OS environment for compatibility.  
     - Provided Dockerfile uses multi-stage build with `yhirose4dockerhub/ubuntu-builder` base image (build stage) and `scratch` as final minimal image.  
     - Ensure all paths in Dockerfile are relative to `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/yhirose_cpp-httplib` working directory.  
     - Build stage compiles `main.cc` with C++23 standard and static linking, producing a stripped binary named `server`.  
     - Final stage copies `server` binary and static HTML content (`docker/html/index.html`) into container.  
     - Use overlay2 storage driver compatible layer instructions for Dockerfile best practices.  
   - `docker-compose.yml` file with:  
     - Build context set to current directory (relative to `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/yhirose_cpp-httplib`).  
     - Port mapping `8080:80` to expose container port.  
     - Volume mount binding `./docker/html` on host to `/html` in container for static content.  
   - `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file configured with clang-format hook:  
     - Uses repo `https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-clang-format`  
     - Version pinned to `v18.1.8` or latest stable version  
     - Hook configured to run `clang-format` on files matching `\.(cpp|cc|h)$` with in-place fixing (`-i` argument)  
   - Build configuration files (e.g., `CMakeLists.txt`, Makefile) for compiling the project, linking necessary libraries (OpenSSL, zlib, Brotli, Zstd)  
   - Optional: Configuration for logging output destinations if customized logging is used  
   - Optional: Signal handler code to handle or ignore SIGPIPE signals on UNIX-like systems if SSL and signal issues are a concern  

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:  
   - HTTP server basic routing and response correctness (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS)  
   - HTTPS server setup and SSL handshake success/failure scenarios  
   - SSL error handling and detailed error reporting  
   - Static file serving correctness including MIME type mappings and mount points  
   - Form data handling (URL-encoded and multipart) including file uploads and field validations  
   - Content streaming with content provider and receiver handlers  
   - Chunked transfer encoding correctness with and without trailer headers  
   - Logging functionality: access log, pre-compression log, error log for both server and client

   - Edge cases for regex route handlers to avoid stack overflow  
   - Redirect handling and automatic path encoding on client requests  
   - Range header support in client requests and server responses  
   - Error and exception handler correctness for server route handlers  
   - Code style and formatting compliance verification via pre-commit hook with clang-format:  
     - Test that code files (`*.cpp`, `*.cc`, `*.h`) are correctly formatted and that the hook automatically fixes or rejects non-compliant code at commit time.  
     - Verify pre-commit hook installation and execution on commit.  

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST:  
   1. Install a modern C++ compiler supporting at least C++11 on your OS, targeting x86_64 architecture.  
      - For building the Docker static server image, ensure GCC with C++23 support (GCC 11+ recommended) for x86_64.  
      - Verify by compiling a simple C++11 program using `<regex>`.  
   2. Install OpenSSL version 3.0 or later.  
      - Verify by running `openssl version` command.  
   3. Install zlib development libraries for gzip compression support.  
   4. Optionally install Brotli and Zstd libraries if additional compression methods are required.  
      - Follow official repositories for build and installation instructions.  
   5. On macOS, ensure `CoreFoundation` and `Security` frameworks are available and can be linked.  
   6. Obtain or generate SSL certificates (`cert.pem` and `key.pem`) for HTTPS server testing.  
   7. Download or clone the cpp-httplib repository into `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/yhirose_cpp-httplib` and extract `httplib.h`.  
   8. Optionally run the `split.py` script to split `httplib.h` into `httplib.h` and `httplib.cc` for better compilation management.  
      - Verify files are created correctly in the output directory within the working path.  
   9. Create or update build configuration files (Makefile, CMakeLists.txt) that:  
      - Compile your source code including `httplib.h` and optionally `httplib.cc`.  
      - Link against OpenSSL (`libssl`, `libcrypto`), zlib, Brotli, and Zstd as needed.  
      - Link macOS frameworks if applicable (e.g., `-framework CoreFoundation -framework Security`).  
   10. Install Python and the `pre-commit` framework on your development machine:  
       - Install Python from the official source or system package manager.  
       - Install pre-commit with `pip install pre-commit`.  
   11. Add `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file to your project root with clang-format hook configured to run on C++ source and header files.  
   12. Run `pre-commit install` to set up the git hook scripts for automatic code formatting on commit.  
   13. Test the pre-commit hook by making code changes with inconsistent formatting, then committing to verify clang-format is invoked and fixes or rejects the commit accordingly.  
   14. Implement or include signal handler for SIGPIPE to ignore or handle the signal gracefully on UNIX-like systems for SSL stability.  
       - Verify by running server with SSL enabled and confirming it does not crash on broken connections.  
   15. Write test cases covering all listed necessary test points in section 3.  
       - Use unit testing frameworks like GoogleTest or Catch2 for automated testing.  
       - Validate server routing, SSL handshake, error handling, static file serving, form data processing, streaming, chunked encoding, logging, authentication, proxy, timeouts, compression, Unix sockets, URI utilities, thread pools, error/exception handlers, Docker container server behavior, and code style compliance.  
   16. Docker usage for static HTTP server:  
       - Use the provided Dockerfile with a multi-stage build:  
         - Build stage uses `yhirose4dockerhub/ubuntu-builder` image compatible with x86_64 architecture, compiles `main.cc` with C++23 and static linking, producing a stripped binary named `server`.  
         - Final stage uses `scratch` image, copies the `server` binary and static HTML content (`docker/html/index.html`) into container.  
         - Ensure all paths in Dockerfile are relative to `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/yhirose_cpp-httplib`.  
         - Follow Docker overlay2 storage driver best practices in Dockerfile layering.  
       - Build the Docker image by running:  
         ```
         docker build -t cpp-httplib-static-server /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/yhirose_cpp-httplib
         ```  
       - Run the container with port mapping (e.g., `docker run -p 8080:80 cpp-httplib-static-server`).  
       - Verify static files are served correctly by accessing `http://localhost:8080`.  
   17. Use Docker Compose to manage the HTTP service container:  
       - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the service definition as provided, building the image from the current directory.  
       - Map host port 8080 to container port 80.  
       - Mount `./docker/html` inside `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/yhirose_cpp-httplib/docker/html` on host to `/html` in container.  
       - Build and start the service by running:  
         ```
         docker-compose up --build
         ```  
         from `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/yhirose_cpp-httplib`.  
       - Verify container starts correctly, ports are mapped as expected, and static files in `./docker/html` are served properly.  
       - Use `docker-compose down` to stop and remove the container and network after testing.  
   18. For Windows environment (if applicable):  
       - Include `httplib.h` before including `Windows.h` or define `WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN` before `Windows.h`.  
       - Use latest Visual Studio supported by cpp-httplib.  
       - Verify compilation and runtime behavior.  
   19. For Unix Domain Socket support (Linux/macOS):  
       - Test server and client with `AF_UNIX` socket family.  
       - Verify socket file creation, permission, and communication.  
   20. Test client configurations with various authentication methods and proxy settings.  
   21. Verify compression and decompression behavior with server and client settings for gzip, Brotli, and Zstd.  
   22. Validate redirect following and URL path encoding behaviors in client requests.  
   23. Test range request headers and partial content responses.  
   24. Confirm thread pool task queue customization and default thread pool behavior.  
   25. Review and test regex route patterns to avoid stack overflow issues; prefer path parameters or safer regex patterns.  
   26. Document environment setup and build instructions tailored to x86_64 Linux environment and project directory structure for future reference.
