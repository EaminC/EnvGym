- Working Directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/nushell_nushell; project likely user-space code, ensure context paths relative to this
- Architecture: x86_64; recommended --platform=linux/amd64
- Base Image: amd64 Linux base images (e.g., ubuntu, debian, alpine) without GPU-specific tags
- GPU: No NVIDIA GPU detected; no CUDA base image recommended
- Instruction Notes: Use overlay2 storage driver compatible instructions; no GPU-related instructions needed; consider multi-stage builds for large projects; ensure file paths relative to working directory
- Docker Version: 28.3.2; supports BuildKit and docker buildx; GPU build features available but unused due to no NVIDIA GPU detected
