Adjusted Environment Setup Plan:

1. Base Image Selection:
   - Use an x86_64 compatible base image such as `ubuntu:22.04`, `debian:bookworm-slim`, or `alpine:3.18` with the `amd64` tag to ensure CPU architecture compatibility.
   - Avoid CUDA or NVIDIA GPU related base images since no NVIDIA GPU is detected.

2. Dockerfile Configuration:
   - Use `--platform=linux/amd64` in the `docker build` command to ensure compatibility with the host architecture.
   - Use overlay2 storage driver compatible commands and configurations.
   - Ensure all `COPY` instructions reference paths relative to the working directory `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/rfuse`.
     For example:
     ```
     COPY ./rfuse /app/rfuse
     ```
   - Set working directory inside the container appropriately, e.g., `/app` or `/app/rfuse`.

3. GPU and CUDA:
   - Do not include any GPU-specific instructions or CUDA toolkit installations in the Dockerfile or environment setup.

4. Memory and Storage:
   - Verify that the host system has sufficient RAM and disk space for the environment, but no specific adjustment is needed here unless known constraints exist.
   - Use multi-stage builds if the image size is a concern to reduce final image size.

5. Development Tools and Versions:
   - Install development tools compatible with x86_64 architecture.
   - Use package managersâ€™ latest stable versions available for the selected base image.
   - Avoid ARM-specific binaries or libraries.

6. Docker Build Command Example:
   ```
   DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t data-gpt4.1mini-rfuse .
   ```

7. Runtime:
   - Since no GPU is available, do not pass `--gpus` flag during `docker run`.
   - Mount volumes or bind mounts if necessary, ensuring paths correspond to the host working directory `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/rfuse`.

Summary:
- Use x86_64 (amd64) base images without GPU support.
- Ensure Docker build and run commands specify `--platform=linux/amd64`.
- Adjust paths in Dockerfile to be relative to `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/rfuse`.
- Exclude CUDA and GPU-related setup.
- Use overlay2 compatible Docker storage instructions.

This plan aligns with the provided hardware environment ensuring compatibility and smooth operation.
