current progress  
- Base image ubuntu:22.04 is correctly selected for x86_64 architecture.  
- Dockerfile sets working directory and installs necessary packages.  
- Attempts to copy ./rfuse directory into /app/rfuse but fails due to missing source path error.  
- Python virtual environment setup and dependency installation commands are included.  
- No GPU or CUDA related instructions present, aligning with the plan.  

next step  
- Ensure the source path `./rfuse` exists relative to the Docker build context `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/rfuse` before running the build.  
- Verify the Docker build context is set correctly to `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/rfuse` so that the COPY command can find the `rfuse` directory.  
- Confirm that the build command uses `--platform=linux/amd64` and `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` as per plan.  
- If the `rfuse` directory is outside the build context, adjust the context or paths accordingly.  
- Once the copy issue is resolved, rebuild and test the image.
