current progress

- Dockerfile is set up with Python 3.10-slim base image and CPU-only environment variables.  
- Installed git and bash for environment management and script execution.  
- Created and activated Python virtual environment at /venv_seedgnn.  
- Upgraded pip to latest version.  
- Installed CPU-only PyTorch 2.0.0, torchvision, and torchaudio using official CPU wheels.  
- Installed PyTorch Geometric CPU-compatible dependencies with correct wheel URLs.  
- Copied requirements.txt and installed additional dependencies (numpy, pandas, ogb, torch-geometric) as specified.  
- Copied full source code into working directory.  
- Set executable permissions on pretraining and editing scripts.  
- Default CMD set to bash shell for interactive running.  
- Docker build and runtime logs show successful build and runtime with no errors.  

next step

- Verify that requirements.txt excludes any CUDA-specific packages and environment variables like CUDA_VERSION remain unset or omitted.  
- Add a verification step in the Dockerfile or CI to run quick import tests for torch, torch_geometric, torchvision, torchaudio, numpy, pandas, ogb to catch import errors early.  
- Include a test command in the Dockerfile or external script to run `python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"` confirming CUDA is unavailable (False).  
- Add optional automated test execution steps inside the container to run baseline training and editing scripts on CPU to validate end-to-end functionality.  
- Confirm presence and correctness of config JSON files inside the container or add validation scripts.  
- Optionally, document environment setup details and installed package versions inside the container for reproducibility.  
- Consider adding a .gitignore file copy step if not present, or validate existing .gitignore effectiveness.  
- Ensure dataset directory preparation instructions or mounting volumes are included for real use cases.
