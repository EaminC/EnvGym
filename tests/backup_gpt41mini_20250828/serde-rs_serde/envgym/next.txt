current progress  
- Base image set to ubuntu:22.04 with necessary system packages installed.  
- Rust toolchain installed via rustup with stable default and x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu target added.  
- Rust Analyzer installed.  
- Workspace files copied into the working directory `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/serde-rs_serde`.  
- `.cargo/config.toml` created with specified dependency feature overrides disabling default features.  
- `.gitignore`, `rustfmt.toml`, `clippy.toml`, and `crates-io.md` files created as placeholders.  
- Directory structure verified with presence of crates and test suite.  
- Verified presence/absence of `build.rs` files as per plan.  
- Rust and Cargo versions confirmed installed.  
- Docker build fails at `cargo check --workspace` with exit code 1; logs not shown in the execution log.  
- Subsequent cargo clean, build, and test commands not reached due to failure.

next step  
- Modify the Dockerfile to capture and output detailed cargo check failure logs explicitly for debugging by ensuring logs exist or redirecting to a known file.  
- Verify that all dependencies are correctly declared and `.cargo/config.toml` is properly formatted and recognized by cargo during build.  
- Consider adding a `cargo update` step before `cargo check` to ensure dependencies are up to date.  
- Ensure that no environment variables or Rust toolchain components are missing or misconfigured that could cause build failure.  
- Run `cargo check` with verbose and locked features to isolate dependency or feature flag issues.  
- Potentially add a step to verify network connectivity or git submodule status if relevant.  
- Once cargo check passes, proceed with build and test steps using multi-core jobs as planned.
