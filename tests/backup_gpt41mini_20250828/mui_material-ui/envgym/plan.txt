Adjusted Plan:

1. Base Image Selection:
   - Use an amd64-compatible Linux base image such as `ubuntu:22.04`, `debian:bookworm-slim`, or `node:18-bullseye-slim` (depending on the language/runtime needed).
   - Avoid any ARM or non-x86_64 images to ensure CPU architecture compatibility.

2. Dockerfile Instructions:
   - Specify platform explicitly: `--platform=linux/amd64` when building or pulling images.
   - Avoid any GPU or CUDA-related instructions or base images since no NVIDIA GPU is detected.
   - Optimize layer caching and minimize image size due to limited storage (~45GB free).
   - Use multi-stage builds to reduce final image size.
   - Use overlay2-compatible Dockerfile instructions and avoid deprecated storage driver features.

3. Build and Runtime Environment:
   - Leverage high CPU core count by enabling parallel build steps where applicable (e.g., `make -j$(nproc)`).
   - Minimize memory footprint in build steps if RAM is limited (check actual memory if known).
   - Avoid installing unnecessary packages or large dependencies.
   - Use lightweight package variants where possible (e.g., `-slim` or `-alpine` images if compatible with project dependencies).

4. Volume and Path Configuration:
   - Use the working directory `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/mui_material-ui` as the main project root inside the container.
   - Map the host directory to the container path exactly to avoid path conflicts.
   - Avoid volume mounts that might exceed storage limits.

5. Docker Build and Run Commands:
   - Use BuildKit and Buildx features available in Docker 28.3.2 for efficient builds.
   - Example build command:
     ```
     DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t your-image-name .
     ```
   - Avoid GPU build flags or runtime parameters.

6. Development Tools and Versions:
   - Ensure all tooling installed inside the container matches the amd64 architecture.
   - Validate node/npm, python, or other language tools are installed in compatible versions.
   - Avoid experimental or platform-specific binaries.

Summary:
- Base image: amd64 Linux variant (Ubuntu/Debian/Node slim)
- Platform: linux/amd64 explicitly specified
- No GPU or CUDA dependencies
- Storage optimized with multi-stage builds and minimal packages
- Paths consistent with user home directory project structure
- Build leveraging multiple CPU cores without exceeding storage or memory limits
