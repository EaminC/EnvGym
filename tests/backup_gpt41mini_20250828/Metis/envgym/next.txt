current progress
- Base Ubuntu 20.04 image used with essential packages installed.
- User `cc` created with sudo privileges.
- Working directories and mount points created.
- Source code copied with proper ownership.
- Clean and build (`make clean` and `make`) steps executed as user `cc`.
- Attempted `make install` as root user failed in Docker build.
- Python packages installed globally and user requirements attempted.
- Kernel 6.9.4 source downloaded and extraction done.
- Kernel build script created and made executable.
- File permissions for scripts set.
- Environment partially prepared but `make install` failed causing build error.

next step
- Investigate `make install` failure by examining `build.log` and error messages.
- Ensure all dependencies and environment variables required by `make install` are present.
- Consider running `make install` as user `cc` with sudo rather than switching fully to root to maintain environment consistency.
- Add debugging steps before `make install` to verify current directory contents and permissions.
- Confirm that `make install` target does not require interactive input or additional environment setup.
- If permission issues, verify ownership and permissions of install target directories.
- Optionally split `make install` into smaller commands to isolate failure cause.
- After fixing `make install`, validate subsequent configuration steps and kernel build script execution.
