current progress
- Docker build and runtime both succeeded using the current Dockerfile.
- The Dockerfile installs all core build tools, compilers (GCC 13), Python 3/pip, Meson, Ninja, CMake, clang-format, pre-commit, and all specified libraries (OpenSSL, zlib, brotli, zstd, curl, netcat, gtest, squid, tzdata).
- Default GCC/G++ set to version 13.
- Meson and pre-commit are installed/updated via pip.
- All relevant verification commands (g++, cmake, meson, ninja, etc.) are run for version checks at build.
- Working directory is set to `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/yhirose_cpp-httplib`.
- No Windows/ARM/GPU-specific tools or packages are present.
- Environment is aligned with the adjusted setup plan for Linux/x86_64.

next step
- Add installation of `abigail-tools` (`apt-get install abigail-tools`) to the Dockerfile to fully match the environment setup plan.
- Optionally verify/upgrade `setuptools` and `wheel` via pip for Python packaging completeness.
- (Optional) If using GoogleTest via CMake/FetchContent in project, ensure no duplication/conflict with `libgtest-dev`.
- Rebuild Docker image after modification and verify that `abidiff --version` succeeds in the post-build test block.
