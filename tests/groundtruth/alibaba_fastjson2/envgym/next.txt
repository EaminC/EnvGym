current progress
- The Dockerfile is configured for x86_64/amd64 only, using `--platform=linux/amd64` and compatible base images.
- Installs OpenJDK 17, Maven 3.9.6, Gradle 7.6.4, and sets appropriate environment variables and paths.
- WORKDIR is correctly set to `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/alibaba_fastjson2`.
- Essential packages installed: git, curl, unzip, ca-certificates, bash, build-essential, libz-dev, python3, python3-pip, python3-venv, docker.io.
- Docker Compose is installed for amd64.
- Optional blocks for GraalVM, Kotlin, ProGuard, and codecov CLI are included as comments (not enabled).
- Cleans pip cache and upgrades pip.
- The repository is copied into the image, and the container defaults to bash.
- Build and runtime logs indicate successful execution.

next step
- Review if any of the optional tools (GraalVM, Kotlin compiler, ProGuard, codecov CLI) are required for your workflow and uncomment/install as needed.
- Ensure that only x86_64/amd64 images and tools are referencedâ€”currently, this is satisfied.
- Double-check there are no GPU/CUDA/NVIDIA-related instructions (currently none present).
- Confirm all required dependencies for the planned Java, Python, and Docker-based workflows are present.
- Update README.md and README_EN.md to clarify the x86_64/amd64-only support and working directory paths, if not already done.
- Ensure that all Docker run/build scripts and CI workflows use `--platform=linux/amd64` where appropriate.
- Validate that all copied project files are up-to-date and reflect any recent changes in the source.
- If required by the project plan, add any missing documentation notes on architecture support and working directory usage.
