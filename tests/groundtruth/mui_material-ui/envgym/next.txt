current progress
- The Dockerfile enforces the amd64 architecture and uses a compatible base image (`node:20.11.1-bullseye-slim`).
- All build steps use Linux-compatible tools and dependencies.
- There is no reference to GPU or CUDA in the Dockerfile.
- The Dockerfile attempts to create a non-root user with build arguments.
- The build fails at the user/group creation step with `exit code: 4` (groupadd/useradd).
- The Docker build context and relative paths have not been explicitly verified from the log.

next step
- Modify the Dockerfile to ensure that the group and user do not already exist before running `groupadd` and `useradd` (or use `--force`/`|| true` pattern).
- Add checks such as `getent group $GID || groupadd -g $GID $USER` and `id -u $UID &>/dev/null || useradd -m -u $UID -g $GID -s /bin/bash $USER` to prevent failure if the group or user already exists.
- Verify and, if necessary, document or adjust the Docker build context to ensure it matches `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/mui_material-ui` or the intended directory.
- Rebuild the image to confirm that the build passes this step.
