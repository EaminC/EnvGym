current progress

- The Dockerfile uses Ubuntu 20.04 as the base image (x86_64/amd64 compatible).
- All core system dependencies required by the plan (openjdk-11, python3, ant, maven, clang, etc.) are installed.
- The deadsnakes PPA is added, and both python3.7-minimal and python3.8-minimal are installed for compatibility testing.
- Pip and setuptools are upgraded.
- JAVA_HOME is set correctly.
- The working directory is set to /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT.
- No ARM or GPU-specific tools or images are used.
- The Docker image builds and runs successfully, as shown in the execution log.

next step

- Update documentation and CI scripts to ensure all docker build and run commands for this image include `--platform=linux/amd64` (especially if building on Apple Silicon or multiarch hosts).
- Explicitly note in the Dockerfile header comment or documentation that this image is x86_64/amd64 only and does not support ARM or GPU.
- Review and confirm there are no accidental ARM/GPU-specific instructions, package sources, or documentation references in the Dockerfile or associated scripts.
- If any base image upgrades are needed (e.g., move to Ubuntu 22.04 for main Python 3.10 usage), prepare a separate Dockerfile as per the plan; otherwise, this Dockerfile satisfies the adjusted requirements for Python 3.7/3.8 compatibility.
- Continue to validate build and runtime compatibility in CI, ensuring all builds use the correct architecture flag.
