current progress

- The Dockerfile uses the correct base image (`FROM --platform=linux/amd64 ubuntu:22.04`), setting the platform and Ubuntu version as required.
- The working directory is set to `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/anvil` as specified in the plan.
- All required system dependencies (including `git`, `pkg-config`, `libssl-dev`, `python3`, `python3-pip`, `bash`, etc.) are installed for Ubuntu 22.04 x86_64.
- `kubectl` and `minikube` are installed as x86_64/amd64 binaries.
- Rustup is installed and pinned to toolchain 1.88.0, with the correct target (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`).
- `cargo` and `rustc` presence/versions are verified.
- The Python `tabulate` package is installed.
- Environment variables and shell are set appropriately.
- Locale settings are defined.
- Verus installation steps are present but commented out, awaiting further instructions or source availability.
- The Docker build and runtime have both succeeded according to the provided log.

next step

- Uncomment and complete the Verus installation section to ensure Verus is built and available inside the container. For this, either:
  - Copy or clone the Verus source into `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/verus/source` within the image, and
  - Build Verus with `cargo build --release` as appropriate.
- If project source files are needed inside the image for further builds/tests, uncomment and adjust the `COPY . /home/cc/EnvGym/data/anvil` line.
- If the image will be used for running the controller or other binaries, add the necessary build and copy steps for those binaries.
- Review and update any additional application-specific dependencies or steps as needed (e.g., for controller, CRDs, etc.).
- Verify all path and COPY commands are consistent with `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/anvil`.
- Remove any remaining commented or unused GPU/CUDA/ARM references if present.
- If not already done, update related documentation and scripts to reflect the finalized Dockerfile and build context.
