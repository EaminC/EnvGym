- Working Directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data/grpc_grpc-go; likely Go (grpc-go) project, context should include this directory for docker builds.
- Architecture: x86_64; recommended --platform=linux/amd64
- Base Image: Use amd64-compatible base images (e.g., ubuntu:22.04, golang:1.x-bullseye, debian:bullseye-slim)
- GPU: No NVIDIA GPU detected; CUDA/NVIDIA base images not applicable
- Instruction Notes: No GPU-specific instructions; multi-core CPU may allow for parallel builds (e.g., RUN make -j96), but not required for Dockerfile; default user is root; extfs/overlay2 file system
