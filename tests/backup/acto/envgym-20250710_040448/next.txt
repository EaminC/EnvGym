current progress
- Docker image builds and runs successfully using the provided Dockerfile.
- The Dockerfile uses `python:3.12-slim` as the base image and sets up the working directory to `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/acto`.
- All required system dependencies (git, make, curl, wget, etc.) are installed for Ubuntu 22.04/amd64.
- Go (amd64), Kind, kubectl, Helm, and Kustomize are installed as specified.
- Python virtual environment is created and activated; pip, setuptools, wheel, pip-tools, build, virtualenv, project dependencies, and pre-commit are installed.
- Ansible-core==2.17.5 and yq are installed in the venv.
- The Dockerfile ensures the venv is used by default via the PATH.
- No GPU, CUDA, ARM64, or Apple Silicon instructions or dependencies are present.
- The image is ready for further project-specific steps (e.g., code, tests, Kind cluster setup).

next step
- Verify that all project files (source code, Makefile, etc.) are copied into the image if you intend to run builds/tests inside the container (add `COPY . .` after setting WORKDIR).
- Optionally, add commands to build shared objects inside the image (e.g., `RUN make -j$(nproc)`) if you want Docker to handle the build step.
- Optionally, add Kind cluster setup and operator deployment steps as needed for CI/CD or integration testing.
- Ensure `.env` and any other required configuration files are copied or created in the image if needed for runtime.
- Review and clean up any optional tool installations (Helm, Kustomize) if not required.
- Document any manual steps that must be performed after container startup, or automate them in the Dockerfile/entrypoint as appropriate.
