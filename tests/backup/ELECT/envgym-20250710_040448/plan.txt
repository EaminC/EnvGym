=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN (for x86_64, Ubuntu/standard Linux, no GPU, WORKDIR=/home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT) ===

**Key Adjustments:**
- All instructions and package selections are for x86_64 (amd64) architecture.
- No GPU/CUDA/NVIDIA-related steps or dependencies are included.
- All paths use /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT as the project root.
- OS is assumed to be Ubuntu 22.04+ or compatible x86_64 Linux.
- All references to ARM, GPU, or non-x86_64 architectures are omitted.
- Docker-specific notes: Use amd64-compatible base images only; do not use --gpus or nvidia-smi.
- All build and install commands are compatible with the above environment.

**Additional Notes:**
- **CPU Architecture:** All builds, binaries, and dependencies are for x86_64/amd64 only. No ARM or non-x86_64 support is required.
- **Memory/Storage:** Ensure your VM or host has sufficient RAM (at least 4GB recommended for Cassandra/ELECT) and disk space (10GB+ recommended for data/logs/benchmarks).
- **Operating System:** All instructions assume Ubuntu 22.04+ or compatible x86_64 Linux. No macOS, Windows, or ARM-specific steps.
- **Paths/Directories:** All relative to /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT. Set `WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT` in Dockerfiles or scripts.
- **Docker:** Use only amd64-compatible images (e.g., `ubuntu:22.04`, `python:3.10-slim`). Do not use `--gpus` or install CUDA/nvidia packages.
- **No GPU:** No steps or dependencies for CUDA, NVIDIA drivers, or GPU acceleration.
- **Development Tools:** All standard Ubuntu x86_64 packages; no cross-compilation or special toolchains needed.

---

**Summary:**  
This plan is fully compatible with your x86_64 (amd64) Ubuntu/Linux environment, with no GPU, and with all project paths under /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT. All instructions, dependencies, and test cases are appropriate for this setup. Remove any ARM, GPU, or non-x86_64 references from scripts or documentation. No further hardware-specific adjustments are required.
