  ---
  **Additional Notes:**
  - **CPU Architecture:** All builds, binaries, and dependencies are for x86_64/amd64 only. No ARM or non-x86_64 support is required.
  - **Memory/Storage:** Ensure your VM or host has sufficient RAM (at least 4GB recommended for Cassandra/ELECT) and disk space (10GB+ recommended for data/logs/benchmarks).
  - **Operating System:** All instructions assume Ubuntu 22.04+ or compatible x86_64 Linux. No macOS, Windows, or ARM-specific steps.
  - **Paths/Directories:** All relative to /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT. Set `WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT` in Dockerfiles or scripts.
  - **Docker:** Use only amd64-compatible images (e.g., `ubuntu:22.04`, `python:3.10-slim`). Do not use `--gpus` or install CUDA/nvidia packages.
  - **No GPU:** No steps or dependencies for CUDA, NVIDIA drivers, or GPU acceleration.
  - **Development Tools:** All standard Ubuntu x86_64 packages; no cross-compilation or special toolchains needed.
  ---
  **Summary:**  
  This plan is fully compatible with your x86_64 (amd64) Ubuntu/Linux environment, with no GPU, and with all project paths under /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT. All instructions, dependencies, and test cases are appropriate for this setup. Remove any ARM, GPU, or non-x86_64 references from scripts or documentation. No further hardware-specific adjustments are required.
NEXT:
  current progress
  - Dockerfile for x86_64 Ubuntu 22.04 environment has been created, including all required system dependencies, user setup, and Python tooling.
  - System dependencies, Antora, and user configuration steps are implemented.
  - The build failed at the step copying `setup.py` because `/setup.py` was not found in the build context.
  - The log confirms that the build did not proceed past the `COPY --chown=cc:cc setup.py $WORKDIR/setup.py` instruction due to the missing file.
  next step
  - Ensure that `setup.py` exists at the root of your Docker build context (i.e., in the same directory as your Dockerfile or with the correct relative path).
  - If `setup.py` is located elsewhere (e.g., under `src/elect/pylib/`), update the `COPY` instruction to match its actual path.
  - Rebuild the Docker image after confirming the correct file path.

  ---
  **Additional Notes:**
  - **CPU Architecture:** All builds, binaries, and dependencies are for x86_64/amd64 only. No ARM or non-x86_64 support is required.
  - **Memory/Storage:** Ensure your VM or host has sufficient RAM (at least 4GB recommended for Cassandra/ELECT) and disk space (10GB+ recommended for data/logs/benchmarks).
  - **Operating System:** All instructions assume Ubuntu 22.04+ or compatible x86_64 Linux. No macOS, Windows, or ARM-specific steps.
  - **Paths/Directories:** All relative to /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT. Set `WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT` in Dockerfiles or scripts.
  - **Docker:** Use only amd64-compatible images (e.g., `ubuntu:22.04`, `python:3.10-slim`). Do not use `--gpus` or install CUDA/nvidia packages.
  - **No GPU:** No steps or dependencies for CUDA, NVIDIA drivers, or GPU acceleration.
  - **Development Tools:** All standard Ubuntu x86_64 packages; no cross-compilation or special toolchains needed.
  ---
  **Summary:**  
  This plan is fully compatible with your x86_64 (amd64) Ubuntu/Linux environment, with no GPU, and with all project paths under /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT. All instructions, dependencies, and test cases are appropriate for this setup. Remove any ARM, GPU, or non-x86_64 references from scripts or documentation. No further hardware-specific adjustments are required.
NEXT:
  current progress
  - Dockerfile is configured for Ubuntu 22.04, x86_64, no GPU, with all project paths under /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT.
  - User "cc" and required directories are created with correct ownership.
  - System dependencies are specified and attempted to be installed, including all required packages for ELECT (Java, Python, dev tools, documentation, benchmarking, etc.).
  - Antora CLI and site generator are installed via npm.
  - Passwordless sudo is set for user "cc".
  - Python requirements are installed from requirements.txt if present, along with additional Python packages and editable installs from GitHub.
  - Sphinx is installed for documentation.
  - SSH and Maven directories are prepared.
  - Environment variables are set in .bashrc.
  - Build failed at the apt-get install step (lines 18-25), indicating a problem with installing system dependencies.
  next step
  - Review the Docker build log to identify the specific package(s) causing the apt-get install failure (likely due to package name typos, missing dependencies, or conflicts).
  - Remove or correct any problematic package names (e.g., verify if "cython3" should be "cython", and check if all listed packages exist in Ubuntu 22.04).
  - Consider splitting the apt-get install into smaller RUN commands or using "apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends" with only verified package names to isolate the error.
  - Rebuild the Docker image after correcting the package list, ensuring the build completes successfully before proceeding with further steps.

PLAN:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN (for x86_64, Ubuntu/standard Linux, no GPU, WORKDIR=/home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT) ===
  **Key Adjustments:**
  - All instructions and package selections are for x86_64 (amd64) architecture.
  - No GPU/CUDA/NVIDIA-related steps or dependencies are included.
  - All paths use /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT as the project root.
  - OS is assumed to be Ubuntu 22.04+ or compatible x86_64 Linux.
  - All references to ARM, GPU, or non-x86_64 architectures are omitted.
  - Docker-specific notes: Use amd64-compatible base images only; do not use --gpus or nvidia-smi.
  - All build and install commands are compatible with the above environment.

     - All file and directory creation instructions remain as in the original plan, but ensure that:
       - Absolute or relative paths are correct for the working directory.
       - No references to /root, /opt, or other system directories unless explicitly required.
       - For Docker builds, set `WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT` at the start of your Dockerfile.
  ---
  3. NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE
     - All test cases remain as in the original plan.
     - No GPU/CUDA/NVIDIA-specific tests are required.
     - All build, install, and runtime tests should be performed on x86_64 Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+).
     - If running in Docker, ensure containers are built for amd64 (`--platform=linux/amd64` if using multi-arch build).

  ---
  **Additional Notes:**
  - **CPU Architecture:** All builds, binaries, and dependencies are for x86_64/amd64 only. No ARM or non-x86_64 support is required.
  - **Memory/Storage:** Ensure your VM or host has sufficient RAM (at least 4GB recommended for Cassandra/ELECT) and disk space (10GB+ recommended for data/logs/benchmarks).
  - **Operating System:** All instructions assume Ubuntu 22.04+ or compatible x86_64 Linux. No macOS, Windows, or ARM-specific steps.
  - **Paths/Directories:** All relative to /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT. Set `WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT` in Dockerfiles or scripts.
  - **Docker:** Use only amd64-compatible images (e.g., `ubuntu:22.04`, `python:3.10-slim`). Do not use `--gpus` or install CUDA/nvidia packages.
  - **No GPU:** No steps or dependencies for CUDA, NVIDIA drivers, or GPU acceleration.
  - **Development Tools:** All standard Ubuntu x86_64 packages; no cross-compilation or special toolchains needed.
  ---
  **Summary:**  
  This plan is fully compatible with your x86_64 (amd64) Ubuntu/Linux environment, with no GPU, and with all project paths under /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT. All instructions, dependencies, and test cases are appropriate for this setup. Remove any ARM, GPU, or non-x86_64 references from scripts or documentation. No further hardware-specific adjustments are required.
NEXT:
  current progress
  - Docker build attempted using envgym/envgym.dockerfile for image envgym_test_1752105774.
  - Build failed during the "Install system dependencies" step (apt-get install).
  - Dockerfile is configured for Ubuntu 22.04, creates user cc, sets WORKDIR, installs all required system packages, Python packages, and documentation tools.
  - No runtime steps or application-specific build steps have been executed yet due to the build failure.
  next step
  - Investigate and resolve the apt-get install failure in the Dockerfile. Check for missing dependencies, incorrect package names, or issues with package sources (e.g., missing openjdk-11-jdk or other packages in Ubuntu 22.04 repositories).
  - Re-run the Docker build after fixing the package installation step.
  - Once the build succeeds, proceed to verify that all required files (e.g., requirements.txt) are present and that subsequent Python and application setup steps complete without errors.

=== Iteration 4 - [2025-07-10 00:03:52] ===
PLAN:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN (for x86_64, Ubuntu/standard Linux, no GPU, WORKDIR=/home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT) ===
  **Key Adjustments:**
  - All instructions and package selections are for x86_64 (amd64) architecture.
  - No GPU/CUDA/NVIDIA-related steps or dependencies are included.
  - All paths use /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT as the project root.
  - OS is assumed to be Ubuntu 22.04+ or compatible x86_64 Linux.
  - All references to ARM, GPU, or non-x86_64 architectures are omitted.
  - Docker-specific notes: Use amd64-compatible base images only; do not use --gpus or nvidia-smi.
  - All build and install commands are compatible with the above environment.

  **Additional Notes:**
  - **CPU Architecture:** All builds, binaries, and dependencies are for x86_64/amd64 only. No ARM or non-x86_64 support is required.
  - **Memory/Storage:** Ensure your VM or host has sufficient RAM (at least 4GB recommended for Cassandra/ELECT) and disk space (10GB+ recommended for data/logs/benchmarks).
  - **Operating System:** All instructions assume Ubuntu 22.04+ or compatible x86_64 Linux. No macOS, Windows, or ARM-specific steps.
  - **Paths/Directories:** All relative to /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT. Set `WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT` in Dockerfiles or scripts.
  - **Docker:** Use only amd64-compatible images (e.g., `ubuntu:22.04`, `python:3.10-slim`). Do not use `--gpus` or install CUDA/nvidia packages.
  - **No GPU:** No steps or dependencies for CUDA, NVIDIA drivers, or GPU acceleration.
  - **Development Tools:** All standard Ubuntu x86_64 packages; no cross-compilation or special toolchains needed.
  ---
  **Summary:**  
  This plan is fully compatible with your x86_64 (amd64) Ubuntu/Linux environment, with no GPU, and with all project paths under /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT. All instructions, dependencies, and test cases are appropriate for this setup. Remove any ARM, GPU, or non-x86_64 references from scripts or documentation. No further hardware-specific adjustments are required.
NEXT:
  current progress
  - Dockerfile is set up for Ubuntu 22.04, x86_64, no GPU, with all paths and user as per plan.
  - User `cc` and working directory `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT` are created and set.
  - Universe repository is enabled and apt-get update runs.
  - System dependencies installation step is present but the build failed at this step.
  - All required apt packages are listed in the install command, matching the plan.
  - Node/npm and Antora CLI/site-generator are installed.
  - Passwordless sudo for user `cc` is set up.
  - Python requirements and extra pip packages are installed.
  - Editable pip installs from GitHub for cassandra-driver and ccm are included.
  - Sphinx is optionally installed.
  - SSH and Maven config directories are created for `cc`.
  - JAVA_HOME and PATH are set in .bashrc.
  - Default CMD is `/bin/bash`.
  - The build log shows failure at the apt-get install step, but does not specify the exact package causing the issue.
  next step
  - Re-run the Docker build with `--progress=plain` or check the full build output to identify the exact package or command causing the failure at the apt-get install step.
  - Split the long apt-get install command into smaller RUN steps (e.g., install Java first, then the rest) to isolate which package(s) are failing.
  - Verify all listed packages exist in Ubuntu 22.04 repositories (especially `libisal-dev`, `asciidoc`, `wheel`, `chrony`, etc.).
  - Remove or correct any package names that are unavailable or misspelled.
  - Once the failing package is identified and fixed, rebuild the Docker image and proceed to test subsequent steps.

=== Iteration 5 - [2025-07-10 00:04:37] ===
PLAN:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN (for x86_64, Ubuntu/standard Linux, no GPU, WORKDIR=/home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT) ===
  **Key Adjustments:**
  - All instructions and package selections are for x86_64 (amd64) architecture.
  - No GPU/CUDA/NVIDIA-related steps or dependencies are included.
  - All paths use /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT as the project root.
  - OS is assumed to be Ubuntu 22.04+ or compatible x86_64 Linux.
  - All references to ARM, GPU, or non-x86_64 architectures are omitted.
  - Docker-specific notes: Use amd64-compatible base images only; do not use --gpus or nvidia-smi.
  - All build and install commands are compatible with the above environment.
  ---
  1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED
     - **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
       - openjdk-11-jdk (recommended for Cassandra 4.x/ELECT)
       - openjdk-11-jre
       - **Note:** Only x86_64-compatible OpenJDK packages are required. No ARM or GPU-specific JDKs.
     - **Python**
       - python3 (Python >= 3.6)
       - python3-pip
       - **No need for python2.7 unless explicitly building RPMs for legacy RHEL/CentOS 7.x.**
     - **Python Packages**
       - As per `src/elect/pylib/requirements.txt` and `setup.py`
       - Editable installs from GitHub (cassandra-driver, ccm)
       - PyPI packages: coverage, pytest, numpy, scipy, cython
       - Build dependencies: python3-dev, build-essential
       - wheel (optional, recommended)
     - **Ansible and Related Tools**
       - ansible, bc
     - **Java Build Tools**
       - ant, ant-optional, maven (>=3.0)
     - **Erasure Coding Dependencies**
       - clang, llvm, libisal-dev
     - **Other Tools**
       - SSH (client/server), make, tar, git, curl
     - **Documentation Build Tools**
       - asciidoc or asciidoctor
       - antora (install via npm if needed)
       - make
       - python3-sphinx (optional)
     - **Benchmarking Tools**
       - cassandra-stress (built from source)
       - YCSB (download prebuilt or build from source using Maven)
     - **SSL/TLS Development Tools**
       - OpenSSL and Java security libraries (already included in JDK and Ubuntu)
     - **OS Compatibility**
       - All packages available via apt-get on Ubuntu 22.04+ (x86_64).
       - No ARM, PowerPC, or GPU-specific packages.
       - No need for RHEL/CentOS or macOS-specific instructions unless deploying on those platforms.
     - **Internet Connection**
       - Required for Maven, pip, git, and curl downloads.
     - **Optional**
       - NTP or chrony for clock synchronization.
  ---
  2. FILES TO CREATE
     - **All paths should be relative to /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT** (i.e., project root).
     - All file and directory creation instructions remain as in the original plan, but ensure that:
       - Absolute or relative paths are correct for the working directory.
       - No references to /root, /opt, or other system directories unless explicitly required.
       - For Docker builds, set `WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT` at the start of your Dockerfile.
  ---
  3. NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE
     - All test cases remain as in the original plan.
     - No GPU/CUDA/NVIDIA-specific tests are required.
     - All build, install, and runtime tests should be performed on x86_64 Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+).
     - If running in Docker, ensure containers are built for amd64 (`--platform=linux/amd64` if using multi-arch build).
  ---
  4. COMPLETE TODO LIST (ADJUSTED FOR x86_64 UBUNTU, NO GPU, /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT)
     1. **Install System Dependencies**
        - On Ubuntu/Debian x86_64:
          ```
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk openjdk-11-jre ant ant-optional maven clang llvm libisal-dev python3 ansible python3-pip bc make ssh tar git asciidoc curl build-essential python3-dev cython
          ```
          - (Optional for documentation):
            ```
            sudo apt-get install -y npm
            sudo npm install -g @antora/cli @antora/site-generator-default
            ```
        - **No ARM, PowerPC, or GPU-specific packages.**
        - **No CUDA, nvidia-smi, or --gpus instructions.**
        - **No need for python2.7 unless building RPMs for RHEL/CentOS 7.x.**
        - **No RHEL/CentOS-specific instructions unless explicitly needed.**
        - **Verify:**
          - All version checks as in the original plan (java, ant, mvn, python3, etc.)
          - `uname -m` should output `x86_64`
     2. **Install Python Packages and Test Tooling**
        - As in the original plan.
        - Ensure all pip installs are done in the context of /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT.
        - No GPU or ARM-specific Python packages.
     3. **Build and Install Python Package with Cython Extension**
        - As in the original plan.
        - Ensure build-essential and python3-dev are installed (for x86_64).
        - No special flags for architecture.
     4. **Set Up Maven Proxy (if required)**
        - As in the original plan.
        - Path: `/home/cc/.m2/settings.xml` if running as user cc.
     5. **Set Up SSH Key-Free Access Between All Nodes**

  **Additional Notes:**
  - **CPU Architecture:** All builds, binaries, and dependencies are for x86_64/amd64 only. No ARM or non-x86_64 support is required.
  - **Memory/Storage:** Ensure your VM or host has sufficient RAM (at least 4GB recommended for Cassandra/ELECT) and disk space (10GB+ recommended for data/logs/benchmarks).
  - **Operating System:** All instructions assume Ubuntu 22.04+ or compatible x86_64 Linux. No macOS, Windows, or ARM-specific steps.
  - **Paths/Directories:** All relative to /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT. Set `WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT` in Dockerfiles or scripts.
  - **Docker:** Use only amd64-compatible images (e.g., `ubuntu:22.04`, `python:3.10-slim`). Do not use `--gpus` or install CUDA/nvidia packages.
  - **No GPU:** No steps or dependencies for CUDA, NVIDIA drivers, or GPU acceleration.
  - **Development Tools:** All standard Ubuntu x86_64 packages; no cross-compilation or special toolchains needed.
  ---
  **Summary:**  
  This plan is fully compatible with your x86_64 (amd64) Ubuntu/Linux environment, with no GPU, and with all project paths under /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT. All instructions, dependencies, and test cases are appropriate for this setup. Remove any ARM, GPU, or non-x86_64 references from scripts or documentation. No further hardware-specific adjustments are required.

  current progress
  - Docker build failed during the "Install remaining system dependencies" step, specifically at the apt-get install command for packages including ant, maven, clang, llvm, libisal-dev, python3, etc.
  - The Dockerfile up to this point includes: base image setup, user creation, Java install, and attempted installation of system dependencies in grouped RUN commands.
  - No Python dependencies or project files have been installed yet (COPY and pip steps not reached).
  - The build error log does not specify which package caused the failure, but the failure occurred at the apt-get install step for system dependencies.
  next step
  - Re-run the Docker build with --progress=plain or --no-cache to get detailed error output and identify the specific package causing the failure in the apt-get install step.
  - Alternatively, split the problematic RUN command into separate RUN commands for each package or smaller groups to isolate the failing package.
  - Once the failing package is identified and resolved, proceed with the remaining apt-get install steps and continue with the Dockerfile as planned.

=== Iteration 6 - [2025-07-10 00:06:18] ===
PLAN:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN (for x86_64, Ubuntu/standard Linux, no GPU, WORKDIR=/home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT) ===
  **Key Adjustments:**
  - All instructions and package selections are for x86_64 (amd64) architecture.
  - No GPU/CUDA/NVIDIA-related steps or dependencies are included.
  - All paths use /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT as the project root.
  - OS is assumed to be Ubuntu 22.04+ or compatible x86_64 Linux.
  - All references to ARM, GPU, or non-x86_64 architectures are omitted.
  - Docker-specific notes: Use amd64-compatible base images only; do not use --gpus or nvidia-smi.
  - All build and install commands are compatible with the above environment.
  ---

  ---
  **Additional Notes:**
  - **CPU Architecture:** All builds, binaries, and dependencies are for x86_64/amd64 only. No ARM or non-x86_64 support is required.
  - **Memory/Storage:** Ensure your VM or host has sufficient RAM (at least 4GB recommended for Cassandra/ELECT) and disk space (10GB+ recommended for data/logs/benchmarks).
  - **Operating System:** All instructions assume Ubuntu 22.04+ or compatible x86_64 Linux. No macOS, Windows, or ARM-specific steps.
  - **Paths/Directories:** All relative to /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT. Set `WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT` in Dockerfiles or scripts.
  - **Docker:** Use only amd64-compatible images (e.g., `ubuntu:22.04`, `python:3.10-slim`). Do not use `--gpus` or install CUDA/nvidia packages.
  - **No GPU:** No steps or dependencies for CUDA, NVIDIA drivers, or GPU acceleration.
  - **Development Tools:** All standard Ubuntu x86_64 packages; no cross-compilation or special toolchains needed.
  ---
  **Summary:**  
  This plan is fully compatible with your x86_64 (amd64) Ubuntu/Linux environment, with no GPU, and with all project paths under /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT. All instructions, dependencies, and test cases are appropriate for this setup. Remove any ARM, GPU, or non-x86_64 references from scripts or documentation. No further hardware-specific adjustments are required.
NEXT:
  current progress
  - Docker build failed at the step: `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends cython ...` with exit code 100.
  - All previous system dependencies (up to and including `python3-dev`) were installed successfully.
  - The Dockerfile is structured to install each dependency in a separate RUN command for easier isolation of failures.
  - User, home directory, and working directory are set up correctly for user `cc`.
  - Java, Python, and most build tools are installed before the failure point.
  - No further steps (Python package installs, Antora, or project-specific setup) were executed due to the build failure.
  next step
  - Investigate and resolve the cause of the `cython` package installation failure in the Dockerfile.  
    - Check for possible issues such as missing or outdated package lists, incorrect package name, or missing dependencies.
    - Try running `apt-get update` immediately before the `cython` install, or combine related Python build dependencies into a single RUN command to avoid cache issues.
  - Once resolved, rebuild the Docker image to verify that the build passes this step and proceeds to subsequent dependency installations.

=== Iteration 7 - [2025-07-10 00:08:36] ===
PLAN:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN (for x86_64, Ubuntu/standard Linux, no GPU, WORKDIR=/home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT) ===
  **Key Adjustments:**
  - All instructions and package selections are for x86_64 (amd64) architecture.
  - No GPU/CUDA/NVIDIA-related steps or dependencies are included.
  - All paths use /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT as the project root.
  - OS is assumed to be Ubuntu 22.04+ or compatible x86_64 Linux.
  - All references to ARM, GPU, or non-x86_64 architectures are omitted.
  - Docker-specific notes: Use amd64-compatible base images only; do not use --gpus or nvidia-smi.
  - All build and install commands are compatible with the above environment.

  ---
  **Additional Notes:**
  - **CPU Architecture:** All builds, binaries, and dependencies are for x86_64/amd64 only. No ARM or non-x86_64 support is required.
  - **Memory/Storage:** Ensure your VM or host has sufficient RAM (at least 4GB recommended for Cassandra/ELECT) and disk space (10GB+ recommended for data/logs/benchmarks).
  - **Operating System:** All instructions assume Ubuntu 22.04+ or compatible x86_64 Linux. No macOS, Windows, or ARM-specific steps.
  - **Paths/Directories:** All relative to /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT. Set `WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT` in Dockerfiles or scripts.
  - **Docker:** Use only amd64-compatible images (e.g., `ubuntu:22.04`, `python:3.10-slim`). Do not use `--gpus` or install CUDA/nvidia packages.
  - **No GPU:** No steps or dependencies for CUDA, NVIDIA drivers, or GPU acceleration.
  - **Development Tools:** All standard Ubuntu x86_64 packages; no cross-compilation or special toolchains needed.
  ---
  **Summary:**  
  This plan is fully compatible with your x86_64 (amd64) Ubuntu/Linux environment, with no GPU, and with all project paths under /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT. All instructions, dependencies, and test cases are appropriate for this setup. Remove any ARM, GPU, or non-x86_64 references from scripts or documentation. No further hardware-specific adjustments are required.
NEXT:
  current progress
  - Dockerfile is set up for Ubuntu 22.04 x86_64, non-GPU, with all paths under /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT.
  - User `cc` and working directory are correctly created.
  - Java (OpenJDK 11), Python 3, pip, and all required system dependencies are being installed step-by-step.
  - Most dependencies (ant, maven, clang, llvm, libisal-dev, ansible, bc, make, ssh, tar, git, asciidoc, curl, build-essential, npm, sudo, chrony, ca-certificates) are installed via apt-get.
  - Antora CLI and site generator are installed via npm.
  - Passwordless sudo for user `cc` is configured.
  - Python requirements and additional packages (coverage, pytest, numpy, scipy, cython, wheel) are installed via pip.
  - Editable installs from GitHub for cassandra-driver and ccm are included.
  - Sphinx (optional) is installed.
  - SSH and Maven configuration directories are created.
  - JAVA_HOME and PATH are set in .bashrc.
  - Build failed at the step: `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends wheel ...` because `wheel` is not an apt package.
  next step
  - Remove or replace the line `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends wheel && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` in the Dockerfile, as `wheel` should be installed via pip (already handled later).
  - Rebuild the Docker image after this correction.

=== Iteration 8 - [2025-07-10 00:13:24] ===
PLAN:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN (for x86_64, Ubuntu/standard Linux, no GPU, WORKDIR=/home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT) ===
  **Key Adjustments:**
  - All instructions and package selections are for x86_64 (amd64) architecture.
  - No GPU/CUDA/NVIDIA-related steps or dependencies are included.
  - All paths use /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT as the project root.
  - OS is assumed to be Ubuntu 22.04+ or compatible x86_64 Linux.
  - All references to ARM, GPU, or non-x86_64 architectures are omitted.
  - Docker-specific notes: Use amd64-compatible base images only; do not use --gpus or nvidia-smi.
  - All build and install commands are compatible with the above environment.
  ---

  ---
  **Additional Notes:**
  - **CPU Architecture:** All builds, binaries, and dependencies are for x86_64/amd64 only. No ARM or non-x86_64 support is required.
  - **Memory/Storage:** Ensure your VM or host has sufficient RAM (at least 4GB recommended for Cassandra/ELECT) and disk space (10GB+ recommended for data/logs/benchmarks).
  - **Operating System:** All instructions assume Ubuntu 22.04+ or compatible x86_64 Linux. No macOS, Windows, or ARM-specific steps.
  - **Paths/Directories:** All relative to /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT. Set `WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT` in Dockerfiles or scripts.
  - **Docker:** Use only amd64-compatible images (e.g., `ubuntu:22.04`, `python:3.10-slim`). Do not use `--gpus` or install CUDA/nvidia packages.
  - **No GPU:** No steps or dependencies for CUDA, NVIDIA drivers, or GPU acceleration.
  - **Development Tools:** All standard Ubuntu x86_64 packages; no cross-compilation or special toolchains needed.
  ---
  **Summary:**  
  This plan is fully compatible with your x86_64 (amd64) Ubuntu/Linux environment, with no GPU, and with all project paths under /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT. All instructions, dependencies, and test cases are appropriate for this setup. Remove any ARM, GPU, or non-x86_64 references from scripts or documentation. No further hardware-specific adjustments are required.
NEXT:
  current progress
  - The Dockerfile is set up for Ubuntu 22.04 x86_64, with all required system dependencies installed (Java 11, Python 3, build tools, documentation tools, etc.).
  - User `cc` and the correct working directory `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT` are configured.
  - Python requirements are installed from `requirements.txt` and additional packages (coverage, pytest, numpy, scipy, cython, wheel) are installed.
  - Editable pip installs from GitHub are attempted for `cassandra-driver` (scylladb/python-driver) and `ccm`.
  - The build fails at the pip install step for `cassandra-driver` from the GitHub URL, with an error: "Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement cassandra-driver (unavailable)".
  next step
  - Fix the pip install for `cassandra-driver`:
    - Remove `#egg=cassandra-driver` from the pip install line, as it is not needed for direct GitHub installs.
    - Alternatively, use the official PyPI package (`pip install cassandra-driver`) if the GitHub version is not required.
    - If the GitHub version is required, ensure the correct URL and branch/tag are used, and that the repository is accessible from within the Docker build context.
  - Rebuild the Docker image after making the above change(s) to verify the installation succeeds.

=== Iteration 9 - [2025-07-10 00:14:30] ===
PLAN:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN (for x86_64, Ubuntu/standard Linux, no GPU, WORKDIR=/home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT) ===
  **Key Adjustments:**
  - All instructions and package selections are for x86_64 (amd64) architecture.
  - No GPU/CUDA/NVIDIA-related steps or dependencies are included.
  - All paths use /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT as the project root.
  - OS is assumed to be Ubuntu 22.04+ or compatible x86_64 Linux.
  - All references to ARM, GPU, or non-x86_64 architectures are omitted.
  - Docker-specific notes: Use amd64-compatible base images only; do not use --gpus or nvidia-smi.
  - All build and install commands are compatible with the above environment.

  - **Operating System:** All instructions assume Ubuntu 22.04+ or compatible x86_64 Linux. No macOS, Windows, or ARM-specific steps.
  - **Paths/Directories:** All relative to /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT. Set `WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT` in Dockerfiles or scripts.
  - **Docker:** Use only amd64-compatible images (e.g., `ubuntu:22.04`, `python:3.10-slim`). Do not use `--gpus` or install CUDA/nvidia packages.
  - **No GPU:** No steps or dependencies for CUDA, NVIDIA drivers, or GPU acceleration.
  - **Development Tools:** All standard Ubuntu x86_64 packages; no cross-compilation or special toolchains needed.
  ---
  **Summary:**  
  This plan is fully compatible with your x86_64 (amd64) Ubuntu/Linux environment, with no GPU, and with all project paths under /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT. All instructions, dependencies, and test cases are appropriate for this setup. Remove any ARM, GPU, or non-x86_64 references from scripts or documentation. No further hardware-specific adjustments are required.
NEXT:
  current progress
  - Successfully built and ran a Docker image based on Ubuntu 22.04 for x86_64, with all required system dependencies installed (Java 11, build tools, Python 3, pip, Cython, Ansible, Maven, Ant, LLVM, libisal-dev, documentation tools, benchmarking tools, SSH, chrony, etc.).
  - User `cc` and working directory `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT` are set up.
  - Python dependencies from `requirements.txt` and additional packages (coverage, pytest, numpy, scipy, cython, wheel, cassandra-driver, ccm, sphinx) are installed.
  - Antora CLI and site generator installed via npm.
  - Passwordless sudo configured for user `cc`.
  - SSH and Maven directories initialized.
  - Environment variables set for user shells.
  - Dockerfile is clean, modular, and matches the environment setup plan for x86_64/Ubuntu with no GPU.
  next step
  - Add Dockerfile steps to copy the full project source code (not just `requirements.txt`) into the image under `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT`.
  - Implement build steps for the ELECT Python package (including Cython extension), Cassandra-Stress tool, erasure coding library, and OSSServer as per the plan.
  - Add steps to configure and initialize the ELECT cluster, generate cluster tokens, and set up any required configuration files.
  - (Optional) Add test and validation steps (e.g., run unit tests, integration tests).
  - Ensure entrypoint or CMD is set appropriately for typical development or CI usage (e.g., start cluster, run tests, etc.).

  #36 3.442 Building wheels for collected packages: ccm
  #36 3.443   DEPRECATION: Building 'ccm' using the legacy setup.py bdist_wheel mechanism, which will be removed in a future version. pip 25.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to use the standardized build interface by setting the `--use-pep517` option, (possibly combined with `--no-build-isolation`), or adding a `pyproject.toml` file to the source tree of 'ccm'. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6334
