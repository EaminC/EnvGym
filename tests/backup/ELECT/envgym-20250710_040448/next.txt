current progress
- Successfully built and ran a Docker image based on Ubuntu 22.04 for x86_64, with all required system dependencies installed (Java 11, build tools, Python 3, pip, Cython, Ansible, Maven, Ant, LLVM, libisal-dev, documentation tools, benchmarking tools, SSH, chrony, etc.).
- User `cc` and working directory `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT` are set up.
- Python dependencies from `requirements.txt` and additional packages (coverage, pytest, numpy, scipy, cython, wheel, cassandra-driver, ccm, sphinx) are installed.
- Antora CLI and site generator installed via npm.
- Passwordless sudo configured for user `cc`.
- SSH and Maven directories initialized.
- Environment variables set for user shells.
- Dockerfile is clean, modular, and matches the environment setup plan for x86_64/Ubuntu with no GPU.

next step
- Add Dockerfile steps to copy the full project source code (not just `requirements.txt`) into the image under `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT`.
- Implement build steps for the ELECT Python package (including Cython extension), Cassandra-Stress tool, erasure coding library, and OSSServer as per the plan.
- Add steps to configure and initialize the ELECT cluster, generate cluster tokens, and set up any required configuration files.
- (Optional) Add test and validation steps (e.g., run unit tests, integration tests).
- Ensure entrypoint or CMD is set appropriately for typical development or CI usage (e.g., start cluster, run tests, etc.).
