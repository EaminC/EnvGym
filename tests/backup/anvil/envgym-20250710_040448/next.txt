current progress

- The Dockerfile is fully aligned with the x86_64/amd64, CPU-only, Ubuntu 22.04 requirements.
- All system and Python dependencies are installed for amd64.
- No GPU, CUDA, or nvidia-related instructions are present.
- The Dockerfile uses `--platform=linux/amd64` and Ubuntu 22.04 as the base image.
- The working directory is correctly set to `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/anvil/anvil`.
- The build context and `COPY` statements are consistent with the plan.
- Metadata and documentation notes in the Dockerfile clearly state architecture and OS constraints.
- The last Docker build and runtime both succeeded.

next step

- Review and update all related documentation (README.md, e2e/README.md, docker/README.md) to explicitly state x86_64/amd64 and Ubuntu 22.04 as requirements, and clarify that no ARM or GPU support is provided.
- Ensure all Docker build/run instructions in documentation and CI scripts use `--platform=linux/amd64`.
- Double-check that any local path dependencies (e.g., `../verus/source/builtin`) are correctly handled in the Dockerfile and build context.
- If using Docker Compose or CI, verify that `platform: linux/amd64` is specified where needed.
- No further changes to the Dockerfile are required unless new dependencies or features are added.
