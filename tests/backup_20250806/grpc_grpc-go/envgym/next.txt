current progress

- Docker image is being built from `golang:1.24-bullseye` for `linux/amd64` as required.
- All environment variables (`GO111MODULE`, `CGO_ENABLED`, `GOARCH=amd64`, `GOCACHE`) are set correctly.
- Working directory is set to `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/grpc_grpc-go` as specified in the plan.
- All required system packages (git, make, build-essential, openssl, ca-certificates, libssl-dev, unzip, curl, wget) are installed for amd64.
- `protoc` (Protocol Buffers Compiler) for amd64 is installed at the correct version (`25.3`).
- Go bin directories are included in `PATH` for tool installation.
- Common Go tools and protobuf plugins are installed via `go install` using the amd64 Go toolchain.
- The repository is copied into the Docker image context.
- Go module dependencies are downloaded for the root module and for submodules if their `go.mod` files exist.
- No ARM64, CUDA, or GPU-specific steps are present.
- The image build and runtime both succeeded according to the last execution log.

next step

- Review and update any documentation references in the Dockerfile as comments, if necessary, to clarify that only amd64 is supported and ARM64/QEMU steps are optional/advanced.
- Ensure that no references, comments, or commands related to ARM64 or GPU/CUDA remain in the Dockerfile.
- Confirm all scripts or build steps invoked from the Dockerfile (if any) assume `GOARCH=amd64` by default.
- If workflows or build scripts are triggered within the Dockerfile, verify they use absolute paths relative to `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/grpc_grpc-go`.
- Optionally, add a final verification step or comment in the Dockerfile to remind users to check image architecture with `docker inspect`.
- No functional changes are required unless new dependencies/tools are needed; otherwise, the Dockerfile is aligned with the current plan.
