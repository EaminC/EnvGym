current progress
- The Dockerfile is based on `ubuntu:22.04` (amd64 compatible) and does not include any GPU, CUDA, ARM, or emulation instructions.
- System dependencies and Python tools are installed for x86_64.
- Working directory is correctly set to `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/rfuse`.
- The Dockerfile uses multi-core capable build tools (e.g., build-essential, cmake).
- Docker BuildKit features and platform flags are not explicitly set in the Dockerfile, but there are no ARM or GPU flags present.
- The build failed at the step `COPY requirements.txt ./` due to `requirements.txt` not being found in the build context.
- The `README.md`/documentation update is not verifiable from the given data.

next step
- Ensure `requirements.txt` exists in the Docker build context (same directory as the Dockerfile) before building.
- If using Docker BuildKit, enable it by setting `export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` in the terminal before building.
- When building, use the explicit platform flag:  
  `docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -f envgym/envgym.dockerfile -t envgym_test_1753092488 .`
- Confirm all referenced files (source code, requirements.txt) are present in the context and correctly copied.
- After a successful build, update the `README.md` to explicitly state amd64-only, no GPU support, and usage instructions as per the plan.
