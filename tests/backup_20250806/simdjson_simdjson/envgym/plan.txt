=== ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN (ADJUSTED for x86_64, No GPU, Debian/Ubuntu base, /home/cc/EnvGym/data/simdjson_simdjson) ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:  
   - Compilers:  
     - GCC (g++) version 7 or higher (GCC 10 available via `gcc:10` Docker image; ensure `--platform=linux/amd64` for docker build/run commands)
     - Clang (clang++) version 6 or higher (custom build from p2996 branch: https://github.com/bloomberg/clang-p2996.git)
     - Visual Studio/Xcode not needed (target is Linux/x86_64 only)
   - Command-line shell utilities: bash, zsh, etc.
   - wget or curl (for downloads)
   - CMake (3.10+; install via buster-backports for GCC 10 container)
   - Ninja (for CMake/Ninja builds)
   - Doxygen (optional, for documentation)
   - Git
   - Python 3.x
   - make, subversion, unzip, binutils
   - [Optional] Valgrind, lcov/gcov (for code coverage and memory checks; only on Linux)
   - [Optional] Conan or vcpkg (if dependency management needed)
   - rust-all (for Rust toolchain support as per p2996 Dockerfile)
   - Additional system/dev libraries (p2996 dev container):
     - ca-certificates, gnupg, zlib1g, unzip, subversion, libcurl4-openssl-dev, python3-dev, sudo, curl, binutils, linux-perf, vim
   - Docker (for container-based builds/testing; Docker version 28.3.2, BuildKit supported; use `--platform=linux/amd64` for all images/commands)
   - Node.js (version 10+), npm (ensure amd64 binaries if installing outside Docker)
   - JavaScript/Node.js dependencies for large JSON generation:
     - faker (npm package, version 4.1.0)
     - fs (npm package, 0.0.1-security; present for lockfile/no-opâ€”fs is built-in)
   - Version compatibility requirements:
     - Docker base images: Only use amd64 (x86_64) images:
       - debian:12 for p2996 environment
       - gcc:10 (Debian Buster-based) for alternate/test environment
     - clang/clang++ custom build from p2996 branch
     - rust-all and system packages: Use Debian/Ubuntu x86_64 repositories only
     - Node.js and npm: Must be x86_64/amd64 builds
     - All tools/utilities: Confirm x86_64/amd64 architecture; do not use ARM/AARCH64 builds
   - **Removed:** CUDA/NVIDIA packages or any GPU-specific requirements.

2. FILES TO CREATE:  
   - All paths are relative to: `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/simdjson_simdjson`
   - quickstart.cpp, simdjson.h, simdjson.cpp, twitter.json: As described; ensure they reside in the project root.
   - (Optional) CMakeLists.txt, test_quickstart.cpp, .gitignore, README.local.md
   - Dockerfile (p2996 toolchain/dev env): Path: ./p2996/Dockerfile
   - Dockerfile (GCC 10/CMake test env): Path: ./tests/docker/Dockerfile
   - JavaScript/Node.js project files: package.json, package-lock.json, generatelargejson.js, .npmrc, .gitignore, README, generated files as needed
   - **Pathing Note:** Ensure all file paths in scripts and Dockerfiles use the correct working directory: `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/simdjson_simdjson`  
   - **If moving code into Docker containers:** Use `WORKDIR /workspace` or `WORKDIR /app` inside Dockerfiles as preferred; mount project directory using `-v "$PWD":/workspace`.

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:  
   - All as previously described, with these clarifications:
     - Test only x86_64/amd64 containers and environments
     - No need to test on ARM, macOS, or Windows (unless cross-platform is specifically desired in the future)
     - No CUDA/GPU or GPU-accelerated tests required
     - Multi-core build tests (e.g., `make -j$(nproc)`) are permitted given hardware supports high CPU parallelism
     - Large-memory tests are allowed (hardware provides large RAM)
     - Storage-heavy tests (large JSON files) are permitted (ample storage)
     - Cross-container compatibility: Only compare between p2996 (Debian 12/Clang) and gcc:10 (Debian Buster/GCC 10) containers, both on amd64

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST (ADJUSTED):  
   1. Install required compiler (g++, clang++); **Ensure all installations target x86_64/amd64.**
      - For Docker, add `--platform=linux/amd64` to all `docker build` and `docker run` commands, e.g.:
        - `docker build --platform=linux/amd64 ...`
        - `docker run --platform=linux/amd64 ...`
      - Use only official Debian/Ubuntu/gcc/clang images for amd64.
   2. Install wget (or curl), CMake (from buster-backports for gcc:10), Git, Ninja, Python 3.x, and other tools as previously listed.  
      - **Ensure package manager sources are for x86_64 only.**
   3. Install Node.js and npm:
      - Use official NodeSource or package manager repos for x86_64/amd64 binaries.
      - Do not use ARM builds or ARM emulation.
   4. Install JavaScript/Node.js dependencies for large JSON generation as before.
   5. (Optional) Review .gitignore and scripts for correct path handling (project root is `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/simdjson_simdjson`)
   6. (If using Docker) For all `docker build` and `docker run` commands, add `--platform=linux/amd64`. Example:
      ```
      docker build --platform=linux/amd64 --build-arg USER_NAME=<name> --build-arg USER_ID=$(id -u) --build-arg GROUP_ID=$(id -g) -t p2996-dev -f p2996/Dockerfile .
      docker run --platform=linux/amd64 -it --rm -v "$PWD":/workspace -w /workspace p2996-dev
      ```
      - Remove any references to ARM images, ARM emulation, or GPU flags (no `--gpus`, no CUDA).
   7. (If using Docker) Set `WORKDIR /workspace` in Dockerfiles for consistency.
   8. (Optional) Document in README/local notes that only x86_64/amd64 is supported in this deployment.
   9. Continue with file downloads, sample code creation, builds, test runs, and validation as previously detailed.
   10. All tests and builds may assume high RAM and storage (no special constraints).
   11. (Optional) For very large JSON files or memory-intensive tests, document minimum suggested RAM (for reference: at least 8GB, more is available).
   12. **No GPU, CUDA, or NVIDIA-specific instructions, packages, or tests. Remove any such steps if previously considered.**
   13. All completion criteria, error handling, reproducibility, and documentation steps as previously stated, but with explicit x86_64-only focus.
   14. (Optional) If using CI/CD or scripting, pass `--platform=linux/amd64` to all Docker commands as a safeguard.

**Summary of Hardware-Driven Changes:**
- All environments, Docker images, and tools must be x86_64/amd64 compatible (NO ARM/AARCH64, NO GPU/CUDA).
- Docker commands must include `--platform=linux/amd64`.
- Project root for all scripts/files is `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/simdjson_simdjson`. Ensure all relative paths in scripts, Dockerfiles, and documentation reflect this.
- No GPU or GPU-specific packages, flags, or dependencies.
- Ample RAM/storage allows for large files and parallel builds; tests for large JSONs are permitted (no need to artificially restrict).
- Operating system: only Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) in containers, no Windows/macOS/ARM.
- All other steps and checks remain as originally detailed, with environment and path adjustments as above.

**COMPLETION CRITERIA (REITERATED):**
- All needed files present in `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/simdjson_simdjson`
- Code builds/runs/tests pass in both p2996 (Debian 12/Clang) and gcc:10 (Debian Buster/GCC 10) containers, both under amd64
- Node.js scripts and dependencies work as described, with exact versions per package-lock.json
- No ARM, CUDA, GPU, or non-x86_64 requirements
- Documentation, scripts, and Dockerfiles accurately reflect amd64-only target and correct working directory

**NOTE:**  
If you relocate the project, update all file paths accordingly. If you add further containers, always ensure `--platform=linux/amd64` is specified and only use x86_64/amd64 base images.
