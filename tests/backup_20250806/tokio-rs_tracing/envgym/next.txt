current progress

- The Dockerfile for the environment at /home/cc/EnvGym/data/tokio-rs_tracing has been created and placed in the correct directory.
- The Dockerfile uses the correct x86_64 (rust:1.65) base image and sets the appropriate WORKDIR.
- All required system dependencies (git, pkg-config, libssl-dev, systemd, etc.) are installed via apt-get.
- Rust toolchain is updated and clippy/rustfmt components are added.
- All necessary cargo tools (cargo-nextest, cargo-hack, cargo-audit, cargo-minimal-versions, inferno) are installed using cargo.
- The Docker image builds and runs successfully (according to the most recent build and runtime logs).
- No ARM, GPU, or non-x86_64 instructions are present; the Dockerfile matches the specified hardware context and requirements.

next step

- (Optional) Add installation of mdbook if documentation building is required:
  ```dockerfile
  RUN cargo install mdbook --locked --verbose || true
  ```
- (Optional) Add installation of wasm-pack if WASM testing or builds are needed:
  ```dockerfile
  RUN cargo install wasm-pack --locked --verbose || true
  ```
- (Optional) Clean up temporary cargo registry/cache files to reduce image size:
  ```dockerfile
  RUN rm -rf /usr/local/cargo/registry /usr/local/cargo/git
  ```
- Review if any additional project-specific tools or scripts need installation.
- Proceed to implement and test the environment setup as described in the plan (i.e., clone project, run builds/tests inside the container).
- Ensure CI/CD is configured to use this Dockerfile and that `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/tokio-rs_tracing` is used as the project root in all scripts and pipelines.
