current progress

- Docker image is built successfully using a Dockerfile based on `node:20-bullseye` for `linux/amd64`.
- All required system dependencies (including Playwright browser dependencies and git) are installed via apt.
- Global install of `pnpm@10.4.0` is complete.
- Project files are copied into the container.
- Executable permissions are set on scripts in `packages/svelte/scripts` if that directory exists.
- All dependencies are installed using `pnpm install`.
- Playwright browsers are installed via `npx playwright install`.
- Port 5173 is exposed.
- The container CMD is set to start a shell (`/bin/sh`) for manual investigation/debugging (not yet running the app).

next step

- Change the Dockerfile `CMD` from `["/bin/sh"]` to `["pnpm", "run", "dev"]` to start the Svelte app automatically when the container runs.
- (Optional) If you want to keep shell access for debugging, create a separate Docker Compose service or use `docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/sh ...` as needed.
- Ensure documentation is updated to reflect that the Dockerfile now starts the app by default.
- (Optional) Test the container by running it and verifying that the app starts and is accessible on port 5173.
