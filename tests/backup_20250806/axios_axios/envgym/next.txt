current progress

- Dockerfile has been created based on the plan, targeting Linux x86_64 with Node.js 18 (node:18-bullseye), and using the correct working directory (/home/cc/EnvGym/data/axios_axios).
- All necessary system dependencies for browser testing (chromium, firefox, xvfb, etc.) are installed.
- Bower is installed globally (optional, as per plan).
- Project files are copied in before npm ci to ensure all scripts and hooks are present.
- npm dependencies are installed with npm ci, and the project is built.
- Environment variables for headless browser testing and node memory are set.
- Common test ports are exposed.
- Docker build and runtime logs indicate successful execution.
- The default CMD is an interactive shell (for debugging), not for automated test/build execution.

next step

- Update the Dockerfile CMD to run automated tests or the default build/test script, replacing the interactive shell with the intended entrypoint (e.g., `CMD ["npm", "test"]` or your projectâ€™s main test command).
- (Optional) Add a README note confirming that Safari is unavailable for local tests in Linux/Docker, and Sauce Labs is required for Safari coverage.
- Verify that karma.conf.cjs and documentation restrict local browsers to ChromeHeadless/FirefoxHeadless and note the Safari limitation.
- No further changes to system dependencies or platform configuration are required unless project-specific test/build scripts need adjustment.
