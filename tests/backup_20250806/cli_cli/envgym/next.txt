current progress
- Docker build and runtime succeeded using the provided Dockerfile.
- Base image is correctly set to Go 1.24 (linux/amd64) devcontainer.
- All required apt packages for Linux x86_64 development are installed.
- GitHub CLI (`gh`), `cosign`, `goreleaser`, and `golangci-lint` are installed with latest x86_64 Linux releases.
- Node.js/npm installation step is present (enabled).
- Go 1.24.x version is confirmed.
- Working directory and shell are correctly set.
- Project files are not yet copied into the image (COPY command is commented).
- Optional user setup for `cc` is commented.
- Dockerfile is fully aligned with the environment setup plan for Linux x86_64, aside from commented COPY and user lines.

next step
- Uncomment or add the `COPY . /home/cc/EnvGym/data/cli_cli` line to include project files in the image, if project build/test is to be run in Docker.
- Add or uncomment the user setup (if running as non-root user is desired), and adjust permissions accordingly.
- Remove or comment out the Node.js/npm installation step if documentation build or JS tools are not required, to streamline the image.
- Ensure any needed project-specific setup scripts (e.g., `setup-linux.sh`) are included and executable in the image.
- Optionally, add explicit healthcheck or verification steps if used in CI/CD.
