current progress
- Docker image based on Ubuntu 22.04 builds and runs successfully.
- All essential system dependencies for headless browser testing and builds are installed.
- Node.js 18.x (LTS), npm, git, and Deno are installed and verified.
- Working directory is set to /home/cc/EnvGym/data/darkreader_darkreader.
- package.json and package-lock.json are copied and npm install completes, including optional Linux-only dependencies.
- The rest of the source code and configs are copied.
- Optional Plus variant symlink creation is conditionally handled.
- Full build (`npm run build:all`) runs during image build; no build errors reported.
- Entrypoint is bash for flexible CI/CD use.
- npm cache is cleaned for smaller image.
- Image labels document the environment and purpose.

next step
- Add test execution steps to the Dockerfile, such as `RUN npm run test:all` and/or other relevant test/lint commands, to ensure automated validation within the image.
- Optionally, add lint/code style checks: e.g., `RUN npm run lint && npm run code-style`.
- (Optional) Add manual or automated documentation update steps if needed.
- (Optional) Clean up any unnecessary files/artifacts after build and test stages.
- Ensure the Dockerfile and build process document/echo Linux-only, x86_64-only, and no Safari/macOS/Windows support in README or build logs as per the plan.
- (If applicable) Add CI-specific user/permissions or entrypoint adjustments for non-root operation.
