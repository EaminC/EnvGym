**Adjusted Environment Setup Plan**

1. **Base Image**
   - Use an x86_64-compatible image such as `ubuntu:22.04` or `python:3.10-slim` (no CUDA/NVIDIA required).
   - Example:  
     ```Dockerfile
     FROM python:3.10-slim
     # or
     FROM ubuntu:22.04
     ```
   - Add `--platform=linux/amd64` to `docker build` if building on a non-amd64 host.

2. **Working Directory**
   - Set working directory to `/app` or to a suitable subdirectory reflecting your project structure.  
     ```Dockerfile
     WORKDIR /app
     ```
   - If project code/data is in `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/CrossPrefetch`, copy or mount this path as `/app` inside container.

3. **GPU and CUDA**
   - **Do NOT** use any CUDA/NVIDIA-specific base images or dependencies.
   - **Do NOT** use `--gpus` flags or install GPU libraries.
   - Remove any `nvidia-*`, `cudatoolkit`, or similar GPU-related packages from install scripts.

4. **CPU and Memory Usage**
   - Large memory and multi-core CPU are available:  
     - Enable multi-threaded build processes and set parallelization flags where possible (e.g., `make -j$(nproc)`).
     - For Python, consider using libraries that can leverage multiple cores (e.g., `joblib`, `multiprocessing`).
   - No need to optimize for low-memory environments.

5. **Operating System Compatibility**
   - Ensure all packages and dependencies are compatible with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
   - Use `apt-get` or `pip` to install dependencies as needed.
   - Avoid installing systemd unless your application requires it as PID 1 (e.g., for services).

6. **Development Tools**
   - Install necessary development tools for building and debugging (e.g., `build-essential`, `git`, `vim`), making sure they are compatible with Ubuntu 22.04.
   - Example:
     ```Dockerfile
     RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
         build-essential \
         git \
         vim \
         && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
     ```

7. **Storage**
   - Ensure there is sufficient disk space for your data and dependencies.
   - Clean up package caches after installation to minimize image size.

8. **Copying Files**
   - Copy only necessary source code, scripts, and data into the image to keep it lean.
   - Example:
     ```Dockerfile
     COPY . /app
     ```

9. **Entrypoint and CMD**
   - Define your entrypoint and command as appropriate for your application.
   - If running as a background service and systemd is needed, use relevant Docker options.

10. **Docker Build**
    - Use BuildKit for efficient builds.
    - Use `--platform=linux/amd64` if building cross-platform.
    - Example:
      ```sh
      DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t crossprefetch-app .
      ```

**Summary of Key Adjustments**
- Removed all GPU/NVIDIA/CUDA references and dependencies.
- Ensured base images and dependencies are x86_64/amd64 and Ubuntu 22.04 compatible.
- Set correct working directory (`/app`).
- Leveraged available CPU/memory resources for builds and runtime.
- Ensured storage and cleanup best practices.
- Verified development tools and package compatibility.

**Ready-to-use Dockerfile Skeleton:**
```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY . /app

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    git \
    vim \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt

CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

**Build Command:**
```sh
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t crossprefetch-app .
```

**Notes:**
- No GPU dependencies or instructions included.
- All paths, tools, and dependencies are now compatible with the provided hardware and operating system.
