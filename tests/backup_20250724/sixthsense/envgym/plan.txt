=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN (FOR x86_64, UBUNTU 22.04, NO GPU, DOCKER-CAPABLE) ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED: 
   - Python 3.6 or higher  
     - **Recommended: Python 3.8.x for Ubuntu 22.04 compatibility** (Python 3.6 is not in default repos for Ubuntu 22.04; Python 3.8 or 3.10 is preferable for compatibility)
   - Conda (Miniconda or Anaconda, latest version, x86_64 Linux)
   - pip (latest version)
   - Git (latest version, for repository management)
   - **Ubuntu 22.04 64-bit** (current base image; tested on 18.04, but all dependencies are compatible with 22.04)
   - CSV data files from: https://zenodo.org/record/6388301
   - All Python dependencies specified in requirements.txt:
     - scikit-learn
     - numpy
     - matplotlib
     - pandas
     - jsonpickle
     - nearpy
     - treeinterpreter
     - cleanlab
   - Any additional system libraries required by the above Python packages (see below for 22.04 package names)
   - (Optional) pytest or unittest (for running test cases)

2. FILES TO CREATE: 
   - environment.yml
     - Location: project root
     - Content: YAML file specifying **Python 3.8** and all dependencies from requirements.txt under pip
     - Updated to explicitly list all newly provided packages
   - requirements.txt
     - Location: project root
     - Content: As provided (ensure these 8 packages are listed, one per line)
   - .env.example
     - Location: project root
     - Content: Placeholder for environment variables (if any are needed)
   - .gitignore
     - Location: project root
     - Content: Standard Python ignores, plus project directories (plots/, models/, results/)
   - csvs/
     - Location: project root
     - Content: Empty folder; user to populate with downloaded csvs
   - plots/, models/, results/
     - Location: project root
     - Content: mkdir as per instructions
   - tests/
     - Location: project root
     - Content: Contains test_*.py files for test cases (one for each scenario, including all new dependencies)
   - (Optional) README.md
     - Location: project root
     - Content: Document updated environment setup steps and any new requirements

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE: 
   - Test dependency installation:
     - Verify all packages from requirements.txt (scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, pandas, jsonpickle, nearpy, treeinterpreter, cleanlab) are importable
   - Test train.py CLI:
     - Verify script runs with --help and lists all options
     - Test script fails gracefully with missing/incorrect arguments
   - Test data loading:
     - Confirm train.py can load sample csv files from csvs/
     - Verify correct error messages for missing/malformed csv files
   - Test directory creation:
     - Ensure plots/, models/, results/ are created automatically or handled if missing
   - Test basic run:
     - Run train.py with minimal valid arguments (using small dummy csv files) and check for successful completion
   - Test output generation:
     - Verify that results are saved in results/ and plots/ as per arguments
   - Test feature importance extraction:
     - Run train.py with --tree and --special; check for expected output
   - Test threshold modification:
     - Change thresholds in train.py, run, and verify that results reflect the new settings
   - Test for compatibility and correct functioning of all new dependencies:
     - Write tests that import and use each new package to ensure correct installation and no conflicts
     - For example, test cleanlab functionality if used in project code
     - Test nearpy and treeinterpreter usage if present in codebase
   - Test cross-platform compatibility:
     - Attempt running on Windows/Mac (if feasible); verify basic functionality and note any issues

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST: 
   1. Install Conda (Miniconda or Anaconda) for **x86_64 Linux** if not already installed.
      - Verification: conda --version returns a valid version.
   2. Clone or download the SixthSense repository to `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/sixthsense`.
      - Verification: repo directory contains README.md and train.py.
   3. Download CSV data files from https://zenodo.org/record/6388301 and place them in the `csvs/` directory at project root.
      - Verification: csvs/ contains .csv files as referenced in README.md.
   4. Create the required output directories:
      - mkdir -p plots models results
      - Verification: All three directories exist and are writable.
   5. Create environment.yml based on provided requirements.txt and **Python 3.8** (not 3.6).
      - Sample content:
        ```
        name: sixthsense-env
        channels:
          - defaults
        dependencies:
          - python=3.8
          - pip
          - pip:
              - scikit-learn
              - numpy
              - matplotlib
              - pandas
              - jsonpickle
              - nearpy
              - treeinterpreter
              - cleanlab
        ```
      - Verification: environment.yml exists at project root and lists all required packages.
   6. Ensure requirements.txt exists at project root and matches the provided content (the 8 packages, one per line).
      - Verification: requirements.txt present and contents match above.
   7. Create .gitignore to exclude output directories and Python cache.
      - Sample content:
        ```
        __pycache__/
        *.pyc
        *.pyo
        .DS_Store
        plots/
        models/
        results/
        ```
      - Verification: .gitignore exists and is populated.
   8. Create and activate the conda environment:
      - conda env create -f environment.yml
      - conda activate sixthsense-env
      - Verification: python --version shows 3.8.x; all dependencies are importable in Python REPL.
   9. Install any missing system-level dependencies required by the Python packages.  
      **For Ubuntu 22.04, use updated package names:**
      - sudo apt-get update
      - sudo apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev libblas-dev liblapack-dev gfortran libopenblas-dev libatlas-base-dev
        - **Note:** `libpython3-dev` is replaced by `python3-dev` on Ubuntu 22.04.
      - Verification: No installation errors.
   10. (If needed) Run pip install -r requirements.txt (inside conda env, if not handled by environment.yml).
       - Verification: All packages install without error.
   11. Create tests/ directory and add test_*.py files for each test case listed above, including import and basic usage test for all new dependencies.
       - Verification: pytest or unittest runs and reports tests.
   12. Run train.py --help to verify CLI works.
       - Verification: CLI help message displays all options.
   13. Run a sample training command with test csv files.
       - Verification: Results and plots are generated; no errors in console.
   14. Run feature importance extraction command and verify correct output.
   15. Modify thresholds in train.py and confirm that output changes as expected.
   16. (Optional) Test on other OS (Windows/Mac) in a virtual environment.
       - Verification: Document any OS-specific issues and solutions.
   17. Document any environment variables needed in .env.example (if applicable).
       - Verification: .env.example is present and updated.
   18. Final verification: All steps above completed, main functionality works, and environment can be re-created from scratch with these instructions.

5. DOCKER/CONTAINER-SPECIFIC NOTES (if using Docker):  
   - Use a base image of `ubuntu:22.04`, `python:3.8-slim`, or `continuumio/miniconda3` (x86_64/amd64 only).
   - **Do not use ARM images** (no Apple Silicon or ARM64, as hardware is x86_64).
   - **Do not use nvidia/cuda or any GPU-specific images or instructions.**
   - No need to install CUDA or run `nvidia-smi`.
   - If building in Docker, set:
     ```
     WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data/sixthsense
     ```
   - Ensure that all commands, file paths, and COPY instructions use `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/sixthsense` as the project root.
   - Use BuildKit features as desired (Docker version 28.3.2 supports them).
   - Large RAM/CPU available; no resource constraints expected.
   - Ensure all directories (plots/, models/, results/, csvs/, tests/) are created with correct permissions (for root or user as needed).

6. PATHS AND DIRECTORIES:  
   - All references to project root should use: `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/sixthsense`
   - All subdirectories (plots/, models/, results/, csvs/, tests/) are relative to this root.
   - Data files to be placed in `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/sixthsense/csvs/`
   - Output files will be in `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/sixthsense/plots/`, `/models/`, `/results/`

7. SUMMARY OF KEY CHANGES:
   - **Python version updated to 3.8** for Ubuntu 22.04 compatibility.
   - **System packages updated for Ubuntu 22.04** (`python3-dev` instead of `libpython3-dev`).
   - **Explicitly state x86_64/amd64 only; do not use ARM or GPU-specific instructions/images.**
   - **OS compatibility: tested and targeted for Ubuntu 22.04.**
   - **All file paths updated for /home/cc/EnvGym/data/sixthsense as project root.**
   - All other plan steps remain as originally designed.

**The above plan is now fully compatible with your x86_64, Ubuntu 22.04, no-GPU, Docker-enabled environment.**
