current progress

- Docker image builds and runs successfully on x86_64 Linux, targeting the correct architecture and OS.
- Base image is rust:latest, suitable for Linux/amd64.
- All required system dependencies (git, ca-certificates, build-essential, curl, make) are installed.
- Working directory is set correctly to the nested project path: /home/cc/EnvGym/data/tokio-rs_bytes.
- Cargo.toml, clippy.toml, src/, tests/, README.md, LICENSE, CHANGELOG.md, and .gitignore are copied into the image.
- Rust stable toolchain (>=1.57) and nightly toolchain for x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu are installed.
- Clippy and rustfmt are installed for both stable and nightly toolchains.
- Rust, Cargo, and Clippy versions are verified.
- Dependencies are fetched and cached.
- The default CMD is set to bash.

next step

- Add steps to copy any missing configuration files if relevant (e.g., rust-toolchain.toml, .cargo/config.toml, .github/workflows/ci.yml) if they exist.
- Optionally, run automated tests, lint checks, and formatting checks as part of the Docker build or as a separate stage (e.g., `RUN cargo test --all-features`, `RUN cargo clippy`, `RUN cargo fmt -- --check`).
- If using Docker for CI, consider multi-stage builds to separate build/test artifacts from the final image.
- Ensure documentation build is tested (e.g., `RUN RUSTDOCFLAGS="--cfg docsrs" cargo +nightly doc`).
- Review and optimize the Dockerfile for caching and build speed (e.g., copy only necessary files before dependency fetch, then the rest).
- Make sure all paths and features in the Dockerfile align with project structure and plan requirements.
