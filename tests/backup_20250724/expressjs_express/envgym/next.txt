current progress
- Docker image builds and runs successfully on Linux/x86_64 using `node:20-bullseye` with `--platform=linux/amd64`.
- apt-get installs git and redis-server as required.
- express-generator@4 installed globally.
- .npmrc and package.json are copied and used to install dependencies; start script set to `node index.js`.
- All files are copied and the container exposes port 3000.
- CMD starts redis-server and runs index.js; runtime log confirms redis-server starts.
- The Dockerfile aligns with the planâ€™s base requirements for environment and tooling setup.

next step
- Verify that all required application and configuration files (e.g., index.js/app.js, .eslintrc.yml, .editorconfig, .gitignore, README.md, etc.) exist in the build context and are copied into the image by the Dockerfile.
- Ensure the Dockerfile copies all necessary subdirectories (e.g., lib/, examples/, test/, .github/) before `npm install` if dependencies/scripts reference them.
- Optionally, refactor the Dockerfile to copy the entire project (COPY . .) before `npm install` if development dependencies or local modules are required for the install step.
- Add healthcheck or logging as needed to confirm both the app and redis-server are running inside the container.
- Document Docker usage and Redis setup in README.md as per the plan.
- Test `npm start`, `npm test`, and `npm run lint` inside the container to confirm full compatibility.
