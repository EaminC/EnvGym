**Adjusted Environment Setup Plan**

1. **Base Image Selection**
   - Use only amd64-compatible base images such as `ubuntu:22.04`, `python:3.X-slim`, or `debian:buster`.
   - Do **not** use any ARM-based or multi-arch images unless specifically required for x86_64.
   - Ensure Docker builds use the recommended platform flag:  
     ```
     docker build --platform=linux/amd64 ...
     ```

2. **GPU and CUDA**
   - Do **not** use CUDA, cuDNN, or any GPU/accelerator-related base images or libraries.
   - Omit any Dockerfile instructions that reference `nvidia/cuda`, the `--gpus` flag, or GPU drivers.
   - Remove or comment out any lines that install GPU toolkits (e.g., `apt-get install cuda-toolkit-*`).

3. **WORKDIR and Paths**
   - Set the working directory in Dockerfile and scripts to:  
     ```
     WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data/rfuse
     ```
   - Mount host directories accordingly when running containers, e.g.:
     ```
     docker run -v /home/cc/EnvGym/data/rfuse:/home/cc/EnvGym/data/rfuse ...
     ```

4. **Build and Development Tools**
   - Ensure installation of only x86_64-compatible tools.
   - Use multi-core build optimizations (e.g., `make -j$(nproc)`).
   - Do **not** include ARM emulation tools or instructions.

5. **Operating System Compatibility**
   - Confirm all dependencies and packages are compatible with Ubuntu 22.04 or Debian Buster on x86_64.
   - Avoid any references to Windows or macOS-specific dependencies.
   - Ensure all shell scripts use Unix line endings.

6. **Memory and Storage**
   - (Assuming no specific RAM/storage constraints given)  
     If your application has large memory/storage requirements, check host system limits and adjust Docker resource allocation accordingly.
   - Document required disk and RAM usage for the environment if known.

7. **Docker Version and BuildKit**
   - Since Docker 28.3.2 with BuildKit is available, leverage BuildKit in builds:
     ```
     export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
     ```
   - Use syntax and features compatible with Docker 28.3.2.

8. **Platform and Architecture**
   - Explicitly set platform in your Docker builds:
     ```
     --platform=linux/amd64
     ```
   - Do not include ARM or other architecture support.

9. **Documentation**
   - Reflect all above adjustments in your `README.md` or setup instructions.
   - Clearly state that this environment is for x86_64 (amd64) CPUs with **no GPU support**.

---

**Summary of Key Adjustments:**
- Only support amd64 images and tools.
- Remove all GPU/CUDA/NVIDIA/GPU driver dependencies/instructions.
- Set and use `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/rfuse` as the working/project directory.
- Leverage multi-core CPU optimizations.
- Use Docker BuildKit features; no ARM or GPU flags.
- Update documentation to reflect these constraints.
