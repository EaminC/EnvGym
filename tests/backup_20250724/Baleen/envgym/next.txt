current progress
- Docker image built and run successfully with the provided Dockerfile on x86_64 Linux (no GPU).
- Base image is `python:3.11-slim`, matching the plan.
- System and locale dependencies installed as required.
- Working directory `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/Baleen` created and set.
- Micromamba installed to `/opt/conda` and added to `PATH` (for Conda-based env management).
- All source code copied into the image.
- Dependencies installed via pip from `BCacheSim/install/requirements.txt` (if present).
- JupyterLab installed via pip.
- Required directories (`runs`, `tmp`, `notebooks/figs`, `data`) ensured.
- Dataset trace download script (`data/get-tectonic.sh`) run if present.
- Jupyter port 8888 exposed.
- Default shell set to bash; container starts with bash shell.

next step
- Modify the Dockerfile to create and activate the Conda environment using micromamba and the provided `BCacheSim/install/env_cachelib-py-3.11.yaml` file, instead of (or in addition to) pip installs.
- Ensure the environment is activated for subsequent RUN steps, Jupyter, and default container entrypoint (e.g., use `micromamba run -n cachelib-py-3.11 ...` or update `ENTRYPOINT`/`CMD`).
- Optionally, clean up any redundant pip installs if Conda env covers all dependencies.
- (If needed) Add commands to verify the Python and environment versions within the Docker build.
- Ensure the final image runs JupyterLab (or a bash shell) within the activated Conda environment by default.
