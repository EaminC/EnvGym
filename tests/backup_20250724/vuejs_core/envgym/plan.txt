=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN (for x86_64 Linux, /home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core) ===

**Key Adjustments Based on Hardware Information**

- All instructions, paths, Dockerfile references, and runtime assumptions are now tailored for:
  - x86_64/amd64 architecture (no ARM, no GPU, no CUDA)
  - A Linux OS (Ubuntu 22.04 or Alpine base recommended for Docker)
  - Working directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core (use this as project root/WORKDIR)
  - No GPU acceleration or special hardware requirements
  - Sufficient RAM/CPU assumed for modern Node.js builds, but no explicit high-memory or parallel build requirements enforced
  - Use only Linux/amd64-compatible binaries and containers

---

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED  
   - Node.js  
     - Required: >=18.12.0, ideally >=18.18.0 or >=20.0.0; must support Node.js 22.x for full compatibility (Netlify)
     - Use official Linux x64 binaries or node:alpine/ubuntu images for Docker
     - Do **not** use ARM or ARM64 images (use only amd64/x86_64)
     - For Docker, use: `--platform=linux/amd64` if scripting multi-platform builds
     - Verify: `node -v`
   - pnpm  
     - Required: v10.12.4 (ensure Linux x64 compatibility)
     - Install with `npm install -g pnpm@10.12.4` _inside the container or on Linux host_
     - Verify: `pnpm -v`
   - npm  
     - Included with Node.js (Linux x64)
   - Git  
     - Latest stable version for Linux
     - Install via `apt-get install git` or `apk add git` in Docker; verify with `git --version`
   - Code editor  
     - Linux support (e.g., VSCode, Neovim, Vim, Sublime); no Windows/Mac-only instructions
   - Browsers  
     - Chrome/Firefox recommended (Linux builds); for Docker, use headless or install as needed; do **not** assume Mac/Windows browser paths
   - [Optional] Yarn, Vue Devtools, Serve (all must be Linux x64 compatible)
   - All CLI/build tools  
     - Use only Linux-compatible packages (npm, pnpm) and ensure no binaries are required for unsupported architectures (no ARM64, no GPU)
   - All dependencies  
     - No changes needed, but confirm that any native modules (e.g., esbuild) are installed for x86_64/Linux only

2. FILES TO CREATE  
   - All paths use `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core` as the root directory
   - Use **forward-slash** paths everywhere (Linux convention)
   - All files, subdirectories, and scripts must be created under `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core` or its subfolders
   - Dockerfile (if used):  
     - Place in `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core` or parent as needed for build context
     - Set `WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core`
     - Use `FROM node:22-alpine` or `FROM node:22-bullseye` (or similar)  
     - Add `--platform=linux/amd64` to `docker build` if building on a non-amd64 host
     - Do **not** use any NVIDIA/CUDA/GPU-related images or instructions
   - All other file content and structure:  
     - No changes needed, but ensure all scripts assume Linux paths and shells (`/bin/sh` or `/bin/bash`)
     - Any absolute path references in scripts should use `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core` as the root

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE  
   - No changes needed to test strategies, **except**:
     - Do not include any tests requiring Windows/Mac-specific binaries or GPU hardware
     - Ensure all local development/test scripts run in a Linux shell environment
     - If testing browser builds, use headless Chrome/Firefox compatible with Linux x64 (install via apt or npm as needed)
     - Any CI/CD test or workflow must specify `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` (for GitHub Actions) or equivalent Linux runners
     - Docker-based tests (if any) must use `--platform=linux/amd64` to avoid ARM/ARM64 issues

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST  
   - All steps remain, but with these Linux/x86_64/amd64-specific clarifications:
     - Installation steps for Node.js, pnpm, Git, etc. should use Linux package managers or official x64 binaries
     - Any Dockerfile or containerization step:
       - Use `FROM node:X.Y-alpine` or `FROM node:X.Y-bullseye` (X.Y >= 18.18.0, ideally 20 or 22)
       - Always specify `--platform=linux/amd64` if building on multi-arch Docker hosts
       - Never use ARM, ARM64, or GPU-specific base images
       - Set `WORKDIR` to `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core`
     - If using Docker Compose or other orchestration, ensure all services use Linux/amd64 images only
     - All install scripts, type-checks, and builds are done in `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core`
     - If any step references `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin`, etc., those must exist on Linux (modify for Alpine/Ubuntu as needed)
     - Any references to OS-specific scripts or paths (e.g., `.bat` files, `C:\`, Mac `.app` bundles) must be omitted or replaced with Linux equivalents
     - If using systemd, process management, or shell scripts, use Linux conventions only
     - Any mention of "open" commands for browsers (e.g., `open` on Mac) should use `xdg-open` (Linux) in docs/scripts
     - Storage: Ensure sufficient disk space in `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core` for all node_modules, builds, and outputs (estimate: 2â€“5 GB)
     - Memory: If running large builds/tests, ensure swap is configured or avoid memory-intensive parallel builds on low-memory systems
     - All documentation (README.md, comments, etc.) should acknowledge Linux/x86_64 as the reference environment

---

**ENVIRONMENT-SPECIFIC NOTES (Linux/x86_64, /home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core):**

- All node, pnpm, and npm commands should assume Linux shell
- All project paths are relative to `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core`
- If containerizing, always use `--platform=linux/amd64` for Docker
- No GPU-specific or ARM/ARM64-specific dependencies or instructions
- For browser-based testing (e.g., Puppeteer, Playwright), ensure correct Linux dependencies are installed (e.g., `apt-get install -y chromium` if needed)
- If using CI/CD, configure Linux runners (ubuntu-latest) and avoid OS-specific steps
- All build and test scripts should be shell/Bash (no PowerShell, .bat, or Mac-only scripts)
- For file system permissions, ensure user running commands has write access to `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core` and subfolders

---

**Otherwise, all package, subpackage, and workspace configuration, scripts, and validation steps remain as in the original plan, with the above hardware/OS/arch clarifications applied throughout.**
