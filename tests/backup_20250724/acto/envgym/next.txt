current progress

- The Docker image (`envgym_test_1752983939`) was built and ran successfully using `envgym/envgym.dockerfile` with all stages passing.
- The Dockerfile uses `--platform=linux/amd64` and is fully aligned with the x86_64/amd64 restriction, with no ARM, GPU, or Windows-specific instructions.
- System tools (Go, Helm, kubectl, etc.) are installed for amd64.
- Python 3.12, venv, and all pip dependencies are set up in the correct directory.
- All requirements files are copied and dependencies installed.
- Kind is installed at the correct version through Go.
- Project files are copied, permissions set, and the entrypoint is configured.
- No ARM, CUDA, or Windows instructions are present.

next step

- Review the Dockerfile to ensure all optional tools (Helm, Minikube, k3d) are either correctly installed or commented as needed for your use case.
- Confirm that no unnecessary packages are installed to keep the image minimal.
- Validate that the `COPY . .` step does not unintentionally include any files that should be excluded (consider using a `.dockerignore` file if not already present).
- Double-check Python, Go, and Kind versions in the Dockerfile against your requirements for consistency.
- If not already implemented, add healthcheck instructions or a CMD for typical usage if the container will run services or tests.
- Test the built image with your intended workflows to ensure runtime compatibility and performance.
