Build Analysis for Docker Image - Lottery-Ticket-Hypothesis-in-Pytorch
======================================================================

Build Phase:
-------------
1. Base Image Selection: python:3.7-slim
   Status: SUCCESS
   Notes: Pulled official Python 3.7 slim image successfully.

2. System Dependencies Installation:
   - Installed: build-essential, git, wget, unzip via apt-get.
   Status: SUCCESS
   Notes: System libraries installed without errors; apt cache cleaned.

3. pip Upgrade:
   Command: pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip
   Status: SUCCESS

4. Python Dependencies Installation:
   Command: pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
   Status: FAILED
   Error Summary:
     numpy.distutils.system_info.NotFoundError: No lapack/blas resources found.
   Details: The numpy build process could not find LAPACK/BLAS libraries as required
            for builds from source. Missing system packages (e.g., libblas-dev,
            liblapack-dev, or libopenblas-dev) must be installed prior to pip install.

Runtime Phase:
--------------
Skipped due to build failure at dependency installation step.

Next Steps:
-----------
- Update Dockerfile to include installation of BLAS/LAPACK development packages
  (for example: libopenblas-dev, liblapack-dev) before pip install.
- Re-run the Docker build and verify that pip install completes successfully.
