Docker Execution Analysis
===========================

1. Step Results
---------------
- No successful steps.

2. Build Failure Details
------------------------
- Build failed due to empty Dockerfile (`envgym/envgym.dockerfile`).

3. Root Cause
-------------
- The Dockerfile must contain at least one valid instruction (e.g., FROM, RUN, etc.). An empty Dockerfile is invalid, hence the build failed immediately.

4. Runtime Steps
----------------
- No runtime steps executed since the build did not succeed.

5. Overall Progress
-------------------
- Blocked at initial build step; no progress was made toward environment setup goals.
