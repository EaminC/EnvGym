=== ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED: 
- Go toolchain version 1.24 (or higher, matching go.mod)
- All Go module dependencies (as specified in go.mod/go.sum)

2. FILES TO CREATE: 
- Dockerfile (suggest renaming envgym.dockerfile to Dockerfile for standard Docker build, or use as is)
- Compiled binary (bin/gh) via build process

3. COMPLETE TODO LIST:
- Ensure Go 1.24+ is installed in the Docker image
- Copy the project source code into the Docker image
- Run 'go mod download' to fetch dependencies
- Build the binary using 'make bin/gh' or 'go run script/build.go bin/gh'
- Optionally, generate manpages and shell completions if needed
- Set up the Docker image to run the compiled binary as entrypoint or CMD
- (Optional) Clean up build dependencies for a smaller image

NOTES:
- No requirements.txt, setup.py, or other Python/Node environment files found
- No explicit Docker instructions in README; Dockerfile content is missing/empty and needs to be created or filled
- The build is Go-based and uses Makefile/script/build.go for orchestration

If Dockerfile content is needed, base it on golang:1.24, copy source, build, then use a minimal base (e.g., scratch or distroless) for the final image if desired.
