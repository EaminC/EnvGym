PLAN: === ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
PLAN: 1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED: 
PLAN: - Go toolchain version 1.24 (or higher, matching go.mod)
PLAN: - All Go module dependencies (as specified in go.mod/go.sum)
PLAN: 
PLAN: 2. FILES TO CREATE: 
PLAN: - Dockerfile (suggest renaming envgym.dockerfile to Dockerfile for standard Docker build, or use as is)
PLAN: - Compiled binary (bin/gh) via build process
PLAN: 
PLAN: 3. COMPLETE TODO LIST:
PLAN: - Ensure Go 1.24+ is installed in the Docker image
PLAN: - Copy the project source code into the Docker image
PLAN: - Run 'go mod download' to fetch dependencies
PLAN: - Build the binary using 'make bin/gh' or 'go run script/build.go bin/gh'
PLAN: - Optionally, generate manpages and shell completions if needed
PLAN: - Set up the Docker image to run the compiled binary as entrypoint or CMD
PLAN: - (Optional) Clean up build dependencies for a smaller image
PLAN: 
PLAN: NOTES:
PLAN: - No requirements.txt, setup.py, or other Python/Node environment files found
PLAN: - No explicit Docker instructions in README; Dockerfile content is missing/empty and needs to be created or filled
PLAN: - The build is Go-based and uses Makefile/script/build.go for orchestration
PLAN: 
PLAN: If Dockerfile content is needed, base it on golang:1.24, copy source, build, then use a minimal base (e.g., scratch or distroless) for the final image if desired.
NEXT: Next Steps to Resolve Docker Build Failure:
NEXT: 
NEXT: 1. Create a Valid Dockerfile (envgym/envgym.dockerfile):
NEXT:    - The failure was due to the Dockerfile being empty. A minimal, valid Dockerfile for this Go project should:
NEXT:      - Use golang:1.24 as the build base image.
NEXT:      - Copy all project files into the image.
NEXT:      - Run 'go mod download' to fetch dependencies.
NEXT:      - Build the binary, e.g. using 'make bin/gh' or 'go run script/build.go bin/gh'.
NEXT:      - (Optional) Use multi-stage builds to provide a minimal runtime image containing only the final binary.
NEXT: 
NEXT:    Example contents for envgym/envgym.dockerfile:
NEXT:    FROM golang:1.24 as builder
NEXT:    WORKDIR /app
NEXT:    COPY . .
NEXT:    RUN go mod download
NEXT:    RUN make bin/gh
NEXT: 
NEXT:    FROM debian:stable-slim
NEXT:    COPY --from=builder /app/bin/gh /usr/local/bin/gh
NEXT:    ENTRYPOINT ["gh"]
NEXT:    
NEXT:    Adjust paths/commands if needed for your project structure.
NEXT: 
NEXT: 2. Re-run the Docker Build:
NEXT:    - After writing a valid Dockerfile, re-run the Docker build process.
NEXT:    - If the build succeeds, proceed with any runtime/container tests as planned.
NEXT: 
NEXT: 3. If Further Errors:
STATUS: EnvGym Environment Setup Analysis
STATUS: ===================================
STATUS: 
STATUS: - **No successful steps.**
STATUS: - **Failed step:** Docker build failed immediately.
STATUS: - **Root cause:** Dockerfile (`envgym/envgym.dockerfile`) is empty, which is not allowed.
STATUS: - **No runtime steps executed** due to build failure.
STATUS: - **Overall progress:** Blocked at initial build step; no progress toward environment setup goals.
NEXT: 1. Author a valid Dockerfile in envgym/envgym.dockerfile. At minimum, add a FROM instruction (e.g., FROM golang:1.24).
NEXT: 2. Add necessary build and copy steps for your project.
NEXT: 3. Re-run the Docker build.
NEXT: 4. If errors persist, review envgym/log.txt and update the Dockerfile accordingly.
NEXT: 5. Repeat until the build succeeds.
STATUS: Detailed Analysis of Build Failure:
STATUS: 
STATUS: - No successful steps.
STATUS: - Build failed at the initial stage due to the Dockerfile being empty.
STATUS: - Root cause: Dockerfile must contain at least one valid instruction.
STATUS: - No runtime steps executed.
STATUS: - Overall progress: Blocked at the first build step; no progress toward environment setup goals.
STATUS: 
STATUS: Log & Recommendations:
STATUS: ----------------------
STATUS: * Docker build invoked with envgym/envgym.dockerfile (empty).
STATUS: * Docker requires at least one valid instruction ("FROM" etc), and an empty file aborts the build at the very start.
STATUS: * No image built, so no runtime/execution/testing actions could commence.
STATUS: * Examine project automation or CI to ensure Dockerfile is present/populated before build attempts.
STATUS: * Next: Compose a minimal functional Dockerfile (see envgym/plan.txt and next.txt for recommendations) and reattempt.
STATUS: * When a valid Dockerfile is present and build passes, further status/runtimes can be analyzed.
STATUS: 
STATUS: Status as of 2025-06-23: Environment build BLOCKED by Dockerfile misconfiguration.

STATUS: - Build failed due to empty Dockerfile (`envgym/envgym.dockerfile`).
STATUS: 
STATUS: 3. Root Cause
STATUS: -------------
STATUS: - The Dockerfile must contain at least one valid instruction (e.g., FROM, RUN, etc.). An empty Dockerfile is invalid, hence the build failed immediately.
STATUS: 
STATUS: 4. Runtime Steps
STATUS: ----------------
STATUS: - No runtime steps executed since the build did not succeed.
STATUS: 
STATUS: 5. Overall Progress
STATUS: -------------------
STATUS: - Blocked at initial build step; no progress was made toward environment setup goals.

NEXT: 1. Author a valid Dockerfile in envgym/envgym.dockerfile (at minimum, add a FROM instruction).
NEXT: 2. Add necessary build/copy steps for your project.
NEXT: 3. Re-run the Docker build.
NEXT: 4. If errors persist, review envgym/log.txt and update the Dockerfile accordingly.
NEXT: 5. Repeat until the build succeeds.

PLAN: === ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
PLAN: 1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
PLAN: - Go toolchain version 1.24 (or higher, matching go.mod)
PLAN: - All Go module dependencies (as specified in go.mod/go.sum)
PLAN: 
PLAN: 2. FILES TO CREATE:
PLAN: - Dockerfile (suggest renaming envgym.dockerfile to Dockerfile for standard Docker build, or use as is)
PLAN: - Compiled binary (bin/gh) via build process
PLAN: 
PLAN: 3. COMPLETE TODO LIST:
PLAN: - Ensure Go 1.24+ is installed in the Docker image
PLAN: - Copy the project source code into the Docker image
PLAN: - Run 'go mod download' to fetch dependencies
PLAN: - Build the binary using 'make bin/gh' or 'go run script/build.go bin/gh'
PLAN: - Optionally, generate manpages and shell completions if needed
PLAN: - Set up the Docker image to run the compiled binary as entrypoint or CMD
PLAN: - (Optional) Clean up build dependencies for a smaller image
PLAN: 
PLAN: NOTES:
PLAN: - No requirements.txt, setup.py, or other Python/Node environment files found
PLAN: - No explicit Docker instructions in README; Dockerfile content is missing/empty and needs to be created or filled
PLAN: - The build is Go-based and uses Makefile/script/build.go for orchestration
PLAN: 
PLAN: If Dockerfile content is needed, base it on golang:1.24, copy source, build, then use a minimal base (e.g., scratch or distroless) for the final image if desired.
STATUS: Docker Execution Analysis
STATUS: ===========================
STATUS: 
STATUS: 1. Successful Steps
STATUS: -------------------
STATUS: - None. No part of the Docker process succeeded.
STATUS: 
STATUS: 2. Failed Steps
STATUS: ---------------
STATUS: - Docker build failed: the Dockerfile (`envgym/envgym.dockerfile`) was empty.
STATUS: - No Docker image was built.
STATUS: - Docker runtime was not attempted.
STATUS: 
STATUS: 3. Root Cause(s) of Failure
STATUS: ---------------------------
STATUS: - The build failed because the Dockerfile was empty. Docker requires at least one valid instruction (such as FROM, RUN, etc.) to build an image. With no instructions, the build could not proceed.
STATUS: 
STATUS: 4. Overall Progress Toward Environment Setup Goals
STATUS: --------------------------------------------------
STATUS: - The progress is blocked at the initial build step due to missing Dockerfile instructions. To proceed, the Dockerfile must be populated with the required instructions to create a valid Docker image for the environment.
