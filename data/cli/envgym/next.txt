1. Author a valid Dockerfile in envgym/envgym.dockerfile. At minimum, add a FROM instruction (e.g., `FROM python:3.10` or for Go projects use `FROM golang:1.24 as builder`).
2. Add necessary build/copy steps for your project:
    - Set the WORKDIR.
    - COPY source code and configuration files into the image.
    - For Python: install dependencies (e.g., `RUN pip install -r requirements.txt`).
    - For Go: follow the given template if needed.
3. Re-run the Docker build (e.g., `docker build -f envgym/envgym.dockerfile .`).
4. If the build fails, review envgym/log.txt for errors.
5. Update envgym/envgym.dockerfile based on error messages, then repeat the build.
6. Repeat this process until the build succeeds.
7. If persistent or major issues occur, use the Go template as a base:
    FROM golang:1.24 as builder
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . .
    RUN go mod download
    RUN make bin/gh

    FROM debian:stable-slim
    COPY --from=builder /app/bin/gh /usr/local/bin/gh
    ENTRYPOINT ["gh"]
    (Adjust as needed for your project.)
