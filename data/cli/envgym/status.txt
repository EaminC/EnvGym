Docker Execution Analysis
===========================

1. Successful Steps
-------------------
- None. No part of the Docker process succeeded.

2. Failed Steps
---------------
- Docker build failed: the Dockerfile (`envgym/envgym.dockerfile`) was empty.
- No Docker image was built.
- Docker runtime was not attempted.

3. Root Cause(s) of Failure
---------------------------
- The build failed because the Dockerfile was empty. Docker requires at least one valid instruction (such as FROM, RUN, etc.) to build an image. With no instructions, the build could not proceed.

4. Overall Progress Toward Environment Setup Goals
--------------------------------------------------
- The progress is blocked at the initial build step due to missing Dockerfile instructions. To proceed, the Dockerfile must be populated with the required instructions to create a valid Docker image for the environment.
